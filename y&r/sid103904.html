<div class="P">Through the hectic hallowed halls of college, first as a student, then as a resident, and finally as a faculty member, Dr. Joseph Janse was before us as the example of dedication and commitment to a cause. He was more than a college president (National College of Chiropractic 1945-1983). He was more than a person of international renown in politics, education, research, and chiropractic. Foremost, he was a teacher! Always concerned, &#x201C;Did you get that?&#x201D; he would ask, arms raised, elbows bent, and a stiffened right forefinger pointing toward heaven. You would think he was asking a higher power if it understood what he was explaining until he brought his eyes back to focus on his students. He studied their faces waiting for the lights to go on inside. The English language never received such an exercise as when he spoke. Uncommon words pierced reality and definitions always followed with clear examples that even his grandchildren could understand. An artisan of the highest order, no one could experience his tutelage without being edified while being educated.</div>
<div class="P">From his humble beginnings in Holland, Joe Janse experienced poverty and hard times. Supported by the toils of a dedicated father and mother, two older sisters, and an older brother hampered with a severe kyphoscoliosis of the spine, &#x201C;Jozias&#x201D; never complained because they were no worse off than anyone else. The family migrated to Huntsville, Utah, after converting to Mormonism in Holland. Father Pieter left in advance of the family by nearly a year to work and earn their passage to the New World. Their newfound religion instilled lasting values of self-worth and compassion without prejudice and added an eternal perspective to life. Coupled with forced frugality associated with near frontier farm life, hard work, and a keen desire for excellence, Joe excelled in school. He returned to Europe for 3 years as a self-supported missionary for the Mormon church. Upon his return, he sought direction for his secular life.</div>
<div class="P">Janse&#x2019;s mother had experienced severe migraine headaches and relief came only from the hands of a chiropractor. Intrigued, young Joe investigated. Soon convinced that chiropractic had a place, he enrolled at the National School of Chiropractic (Chicago). The Utah townsfolk, including prominent church leaders whom he respected, discouraged the decision. Undaunted, J.J. (as so many affectionately called him) excelled as a student and was invited to join the faculty after his graduation and marriage in 1938. For the next 7 years he would excite and guide his students in the field of chiropractic. He served as Dean of Students, and stories abound regarding his willingness to help individuals with their studies, their dissections, and their manipulative techniques.</div>
<div class="P">By 1945, the business manager of the school (the president had passed away) asked Janse to assume the role of president and was charged to lead the college out of proprietorship into a nonprofit status, a bold move at the time. In the 1950s, Dr. Janse was brought up short by a talented lawyer challenging the validity of chiropractic education because of the absence of an educational standard developed and maintained by a nationally recognized accrediting body. As a result, Janse pioneered the creation of the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) and led the charge to gain accreditation from the North Central Accrediting Association in 1974. He also pioneered, with his close friend Dr. Fred W. Ilii, from Geneva, Switzerland, the early research on the movement of the sacroiliac joints. This work served as a foundation for additional study to document true movement of these joints and describe their relationship to gait and posture. He generated the motivation for the development of specialty councils and specialty certification boards on a national level and was one of the first three board-certified chiropractic radiologists. He placed the school in deep debt to finance a new campus in Lombard,
<a name="PGvi"> </a><div class="pagenum"><div>P.vi</div></div>
<br clear="all">
Illinois, in the 1960s and then proceeded to become the most prolific fund-raiser in the history of the National College to meet the financial challenge. A beautiful campus, debt free, now stands as a monument to his dedicated stewardship, leadership, and untiring efforts.</div>
<div class="P">Some memorable quotes come to mind when we think back to the times of his motivational lectures on life&#x2019;s principles and chiropractic philosophy. When asked, &#x201C;What is it that you do?&#x201D; Janse would respond, &#x201C;I am a chiropractor, nothing more, but incidentally, my friend, nothing less.&#x201D; Perhaps his most memorable quote came from Rudyard Kipling, which speaks of the great spirit of understanding and fellowship that Joseph Janse held for his chiropractic colleagues.</div>
<div class="STN">
<div class="STL">Here&#x2019;s to the men and women of my own breed,</div>
<div class="STL">Good or bitter bad, as though they may be,</div>
<div class="STL">At least they hear the things I hear,</div>
<div class="STL">And see the things I see.</div>
</div>
<div class="P">The accolades could continue, but the legacy is clear. His inspiring example allowed no room for mediocrity or compromise. His commitment to excellence remains unparalleled. How well he is represented by one of his favorite poems:</div>
<div class="STN">
<div class="STL">Oh for the silent doer of the deed,</div>
<div class="STL">One who is happy with the deed&#x2019;s own reward,</div>
<div class="STL">One who in people&#x2019;s plight of night</div>
<div class="STL">has solitary certitude of that which is right.</div>
</div>
<div class="P">Similarly, the creators of this book and its revisions have been driven to bring to pass a text worthy of his emulation. We dedicate the product of our labors to the life of Dr. Joseph Janse in the hope that its readers may come to understand the value of &#x201C;toiling upward through the night.&#x201D;</div>

<div class="P"><span class="emph_I">Few children have the privilege of entering the same profession as their father. I consider it a real honor to be a second-generation chiropractor following in my father&#x2019;s footsteps. Kenneth Emil Yochum, D.C., my father and best friend, provided the impetus to enter this great profession of chiropractic.</span></div>

<div class="P">Kenneth E. Yochum was a resident of South St. Louis, Missouri. He graduated from Cleveland High School in 1933 and the Missouri Chiropractic College in 1936. He was married to Cecelia G. Yochum for 48 years, father of Kay and Terry, and grandfather to five children. He practiced in South St. Louis at the Wilmington Chiropractic Clinic for 45 years. Dr. Yochum presented many lectures at the National College of Chiropractic and Logan College of Chiropractic in the area of clinical practice, nutrition, and the Nimmo technique. He had a keen interest in orthopedics and nutrition, with a special love for radiology. In 1980, Dr. Yochum was honored to be invited to present a lecture for the International College of Chiropractic in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. He was one of the first five certified instructors in the receptor tonus (RT) technique (Nimmo technique), a topic on which he frequently lectured.</div>
<div class="P">Dr. Yochum&#x2019;s untimely death in 1989 deprived his family of his love and guidance and many students of his great clinical expertise. Kenneth E. Yochum was a man of great character and integrity who always put the best interest of his patients before any personal need or gain. What a privilege it was to have been raised in a chiropractic family with such a great role model as a father and leader in the chiropractic profession. He lived his life by a number of spirited commitments. I can remember him saying many times, &#x201C;Son, right is right and wrong is nobody.&#x201D; He spent his life attempting to always do the right thing for his patients and family. A leader in his community in every way, he stood as the pillar of his practice and family. So many times he told me that &#x201C;chiropractic was worth making a difference for&#x2014;extend yourself to make it better.&#x201D; His most memorable quotation involves living one&#x2019;s life as a reflective leader. He said that I, as his son, should &#x201C;make dust&#x2014;not eat dust.&#x201D; How thankful I am to have had a father who cared so much about the chiropractic profession and his family to have extended himself so sincerely, seemingly at every turn within his personal life.</div>
<div class="P">A motivated student of radiology and an excellent radiographic technician, he produced radiographs of the finest quality in his clinical practice in St. Louis. In fact, his name follows many films in all three editions of this book, cases that came directly from his practice.</div>
<div class="P">Kenneth E. Yochum was a very proud man and this was reflected in all aspects of his professional and personal life. His commitment to excellence was untiring and that driving spirit was given to me by this great man. His influence upon my life still continues. He is greatly missed by the entire Yochum family and it is befitting that the third edition of the Yochum and Rowe textbook be dedicated to his memory.</div>

<div class="P"><span class="emph_I">Within a lifetime, a few select individuals will significantly affect the life of another. For both of us, Bryan Hartley, M.D., was one of those individuals. He was a person who seemed to achieve whatever he wanted in life: an extraordinary professional career, diversified personal interests, and close ties with family and friends. Bryan was born in Aldershot, England, in 1926 and studied medicine at Guy&#x2019;s Hospital Medical School in London. He was appointed house surgeon at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in 1950, following which he emigrated to Australia. He became a flight lieutenant in the R.A.A.F. medical branch and was a Fulbright traveling scholar. He was appointed medical officer in the Northern Territory Medical Services in Western Australia and was a resident medical officer at General Hospital in Tasmania.</span></div>

<div class="P">Bryan Hartley&#x2019;s early postgraduate training appointments alternated between the fields of surgery and radiology. He held appointments in surgery at the Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland; Launceston General Hospital in Tasmania; the Royal Children&#x2019;s Hospital in Melbourne, Victoria; and as Surgeon Superintendent at the Lyell District Hospital, Tasmania. His appointments in radiology were at the Launceston General Hospital, St. Vincent&#x2019;s Hospital, Melbourne, and the Royal Hobart Hospital in Tasmania. After a short appointment in Rome as a radiologist for the Department of Immigration, Bryan returned to Melbourne to become the director of the Department of Radiology at the Repatriation General Hospital and held this position until 1981. At that time, he accepted a position as staff radiologist in the Department of Radiology at the Austin Hospital also in Melbourne, the post he occupied until his death.</div>
<div class="P">In his chosen career of medicine, Bryan Hartley excelled in both surgery and radiology, holding specialist qualifications in both fields. This interest in surgery was of considerable advantage to him in radiology, as it enabled him to see a diagnostic problem in its proper clinical perspective. A unique combination of clinical understanding, experience, and aptitude for clear expression made Bryan an outstanding teacher for his many students, residents, and colleagues. His boundless enthusiasm and wry humor provided for stimulating and informative discussions on almost any topic. His opinions were highly valued, particularly in patient evaluation and treatment.</div>
<div class="P">For both of us, it was Bryan who, by example, provided the stimulus for developing our knowledge and abilities and advancing the standards of our profession. His influence on our careers is reflected not only in the use of his personal case material in this text but, more important, in the knowledge, expertise, and teaching methods he so freely shared with us. His untimely death in 1984 now deprives us and others of the opportunity of sharing his special gifts. He is survived by his wife, Beverley, and their children, Lynne and John.</div>
<div class="P">In gratitude we have dedicated the first edition of this book to Bryan Hartley, M.D.</div>
