<div class="P">All disciplines within the health sciences have undergone enormous change and technological development throughout the last century, with radiology being at the forefront of innovation and discovery. The subspecialty of musculoskeletal imaging has been an integral part of these advances, experiencing a long and intricate history, with great changes witnessed over the last 20 years. (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#R1-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">1</a>) For those involved in musculoskeletal imaging, it is a demanding challenge to keep abreast of the ever-changing technology and knowledge base and to develop the new skills necessary to serve the demands of those who seek their services. Clinicians of musculoskeletal medicine face similar demands of selecting appropriate imaging modalities for the clinical situation, interpreting the clinically important findings, and integrating them into the delivery of patient care. Given this crescendo of increasing demands on musculoskeletal radiologists and clinicians, the need to interact, consult, and discuss patients on a regular basis is paramount to optimizing patient care. The purpose of this prelude is to reflect on key achievements of the past and provide a descriptive overview of where we are in the new millennium.</div>
<div class="P">In 1995, the 100-year anniversary of the discovery of x-rays was celebrated. As the first x-ray was that of a hand, so too was it the centenary of the subspecialty of musculoskeletal radiology. Such anniversaries present the opportunity to reflect on the past: beginnings, leaders, martyrs, innovators, and advancements in technology. So rapid and spectacular has been the acceleration of knowledge and technology within radiology, it is arguably one of the most dynamic and challenging specialties within the health disciplines. Testament to this are the evolving terms describing the specialty, from the early beginnings as <span class="emph_I">roentgenology,</span> honoring the original discoverer Roentgen; to <span class="emph_I">radiology,</span> encompassing both the diagnostic and therapeutic applications; and to the more recent <span class="emph_I">imaging,</span> including the non-x-ray producing modalities of ultrasound and magnetic resonance.

<div class="HD">THE EVOLUTION OF IMAGING</div>
<div class="P">The history of the development of radiology is long and intricate. As with so many other significant advancements in science, x-rays were discovered accidentally. In 1895, Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, a professor at the University of W&#x00FC;rzburg in Germany, was working on experiments in his laboratory. (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F1-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">Fig. A</a>) He was investigating the properties of an early cathode-ray tube, called a Crookes&#x2019; tube, which accelerated electrons in a manner similar to today&#x2019;s x-ray apparatus. While conducting a stream of electrons from the cathode through the evacuated tube, he noticed that a plate covered with barium platinocyanoide located at some distance away began to fluoresce. Not knowing what to call these invisible rays from the Crookes&#x2019; tube that induced fluorescence, he named them &#x201C;x-rays,&#x201D; <span class="emph_I">x</span> standing for the unknown quantity. Roentgen then feverishly began experimenting and defining their characteristics, and in little more than a month he had described all the major properties of the x-ray as they are recognized today.</div>

<div class="P">Professor Roentgen produced the first clinical radiograph, an image of his wife&#x2019;s hand, on November 8, 1895, and first reported his findings on December 8, 1895, to the W&#x00FC;rzburg Physico-Medical Society. (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#R2-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">2</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#R3-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">3</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#R4-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">4</a>) (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F2-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">Fig. B</a>) In recognition of his discovery, he received the first Nobel Prize for Physics in 1901. Others soon recognized the potential role of the x-ray in industry and the healthcare professions. Examples of the earliest diagnostic x-rays are those made in 1896 by Pupin of a hand imbedded with multiple shotgun pellets, those made by Frost of a fractured wrist, and a case of osteosarcoma imaged by Manell. (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#R2-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">2</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Thereafter, a global technological revolution began. Pupin developed the first intensifying screen, and Edison, the first fluoroscope, to mention only two developments. In 1921, Potter and Bucky introduced a moving grid mechanism. Sausser, a chiropractor, in 1934 was the first to produce a single-exposure, anteroposterior, full-spine radiograph. The cumulative result of all of these refinements was the production of diagnostic images of improved quality, which depicted abnormalities directing more effective treatment. (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#R2-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">2</a>) (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F3-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">Figs.

<div class="P">These early advancements were tempered with the recognition of the harmful nature of radiation. Many severe and often fatal injuries occurred to those who pioneered the research in radiology. As a result, the use of the x-ray came under close bureaucratic scrutiny and control. Despite these complications, and in the face of increasingly poor publicity, the usefulness of this new diagnostic tool could not be ignored, and innovations in imaging technology continued, aimed at dose reduction, personnel and patient protection, and improving image quality. Previously, the use of rare earth screens, compensating filtration, and high-frequency generators were some of the significant advancements.

<div class="P">The dynamics of joint motion have been extensively investigated with various imaging methods. Spinal mechanics have been depicted with single views performed at the extremes of motion (dynamic or stress radiography) and with compression-distraction forces. Obtaining simultaneous views at 90&#x00B0; to each other (biplanar radiography) has been employed for complex computer analysis of motion patterns. Continuous spinal and peripheral joint motion can be observed with fluoroscopy and videotaped for retrospective analysis (videofluoroscopy).

<div class="P">The use of radiopaque contrast media within hollow organs and body spaces improved the diagnostic evaluations. Introduction of radiopaque substances into the subarachnoid space of the spine (myelography) provided information not previously available, especially in regard to intraspinal and intervertebral disc lesions.

G</a> and <a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F8-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">H</a>) Injection of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc, which can be performed in conjunction with CT (discography, CT discography), has provided both a morphological evaluation of disc integrity and become a clinical provocational tool for isolating a discogenic cause for spinal pain syndromes. In the skeletal system, an opaque medium placed into the joint space of a peripheral or spinal facet articulation (arthrography) has allowed demonstration of cartilage, synovium, and ligamentous structures.

<div class="P">The inherent lack of sensitivity of conventional radiography was countered by the administration of selective radioisotopes (nuclear medicine) that seek out specific tissues and areas of cellular activity. In skeletal disorders the administration of isotopes such as technetium-99m and gallium provided information on bone activity (bone scan) not recognizable with conventional procedures. These are usually performed as a triphasic study consisting of an initial &#x201C;flow&#x201D; study, a &#x201C;blood pool,&#x201D; and a &#x201C;delayed&#x201D; study. (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F11-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">Fig. K</a>) This has been particularly important in the early detection of many skeletal disorders. The combination of computed tomograms with nuclear medicine has added a third dimension to musculoskeletal imaging (single-photon emission computed tomography; SPECT).</div>
<div class="P">In the early 1970s, computed tomograms (CT scans, CAT scans) were first produced, combining the technology of the computer with the advances in x-ray technology. With refinements in machine and computer technology, exquisite sectional images are now produced in almost every anatomic plane.

<div class="P">Further progression of CT and MRI has allowed detailed analysis of the entire human body, including the vascular system. (<a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F23-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">Figs. W</a> and <a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F24-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">X</a>) However, in spite of all these technological advances, many fundamental principles of imaging remain unchanged. The plain film radiograph still forms the foundation for a large portion of the diagnostic investigations in clinical practice, especially in the evaluation of skeletal disorders. This is demonstrated with an example from the past. The radiograph shown in <a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F25-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">Figure Y</a> was taken in 1897 at the John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, Texas, just 2 years after Roentgen&#x2019;s discovery of x-rays. In 1976, the patient, Mrs. Minne Powell Bowers, consulted a chiropractor in Conroe, Texas, for evaluation of a low back complaint. When questioned about prior x-rays, she stated that she had fallen at the age of 14 and her father, a medical doctor, had decided to transport her from
<a name="PGxxxiii"> </a><div class="pagenum"><div>P.xxxiii</div></div>
<br clear="all">
Willis, Texas, to Galveston in a horse-drawn wagon to have her hip pain evaluated with this new x-ray procedure. Mrs. Bowers brought on her next visit to the chiropractor the radiograph shown in <a class="LK" href="sid115907.html#F25-Skeletal_Radiology_An_Historical_Perspective">Figure Y</a>. Although the radiograph has aged and lacks technical clarity, careful observation of the image reveals an acute angular deformity of the femoral neck owing to a displaced fracture. Even today, some 100 years later, the initial diagnostic examination of choice for a similar case is still the same: <span class="emph_I">the plain film radiograph.</span>
