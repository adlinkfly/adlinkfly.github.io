<div class="HD">Incidence</div>
<div class="P">With the advent of modern chemotherapy in the 1930s there has been a significant reduction in deformity and mortality from osteomyelitis. Recently, there has been an increased frequency of osteomyelitis in immunosuppressed patients (cortisone induced, etc.), alcoholics, newborns, and drug addicts. The worldwide incidence of osteomyelitis has been reduced with the introduction of antibiotics. In countries in which the general health standards are low and the population is high, osteomyelitis and its sequelae remain relatively common disorders.</div>

<div class="HD">Cause</div>
<div class="P">The list of microorganisms that can invade the osseous structures is long and varied; however, specific species are more frequently found than others. <span class="emph_I">Staphylococcus aureus</span> is responsible for approximately 90&#x0025; of all bone and joint infections. In the immunosuppressed patient (e.g., newborn infant, AIDS patient, alcohol or drug abuser, patient on corticosteroid therapy), organisms other than <span class="emph_I">Staphylococcus</span> are more commonly involved; these include <span class="emph_I">Haemophilus influenzae, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas,</span> fungal, and Gram-negative organisms. <span class="emph_I">Streptococcus</span> group B is often the invasive organism in infants when the humerus is involved.

<div class="HD">Clinical Features</div>
<div class="P">The clinical presentation of pyogenic osteomyelitis has changed dramatically since the beginning of modern chemotherapy in the 1930s. Before then, the disease was often an acute, virulent disorder that resulted in death from septic complications before a

<br clear="all">
diagnosis could be made. Current drug therapies modify the severity, duration, course, and prognosis of suppurative osteomyelitis.</div>
<div class="P">The clinical features of suppurative osteomyelitis vary significantly among infants, young children, and adults. Infants and young patients present with an acute process characterized by fever, chills, pain, and swelling over the affected body part. There is frequently an extensive loss of limb function. Elevated white blood cell counts with a Schilling&#x2019;s shift to the left and an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) frequently occur relatively early. The signs and symptoms in an adult patient are often varied and reflect a more chronic or insidious process. The usual mode of presentation is fever, malaise, edema, erythema, and pain over the affected area. Pre-existing infection of other organ systems, most commonly the skin, respiratory tract, and genitourinary tract, is identified in 50&#x0025; of cases.</div>
<div class="P">Suppurative osteomyelitis occurs most often between the ages of 2 and 12 years, with a 3:1 male predominance, which is thought to be explained by the observation that boys have a greater exposure to trauma. Most commonly, the large tubular bones of the extremities are affected. The femur is the most common bone involved; the tibia, humerus, and radius are also favored sites. Clavicle involvement is rare (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R7-12">7</a>), as is involvement of the pelvis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R8-12">8</a>) When involvement of the pelvis does occur it commonly affects the ilium and is rarely preceded by trauma. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R8-12">8</a>)</div>
<div class="P">A major predisposing factor to the development of suppurative osteomyelitis is intravenous drug addiction, such as heroin. The most common microbes are <span class="emph_I">Staphylococcus aureus</span> and <span class="emph_I">Pseudomonas</span> (mainliners&#x2019; syndrome). (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R9-12">9</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R10-12">10</a>) An unusual predilection for the axial skeleton has been noted. The greatest involvement is that of the <span class="emph_I">S joints:</span> <span class="emph_B">s</span>pine, <span class="emph_B">s</span>acroiliac, <span class="emph_B">s</span>ymphysis pubis, and <span class="emph_B">s</span>ternoclavicular. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R6-12">6</a>) In addition, diabetic, steroid-immunosuppressed, and hemodialysis patients are all particularly vulnerable (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R6-12">6</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R11-12">11</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R12-12">12</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R13-12">13</a>). In diabetic patients a <span class="emph_I">sausage</span> appearance or deformity of a pedal digit is a reliable physical sign of osteomyelitis.

<div class="HD">Vascular Anatomy</div>
<div class="P">To better understand the pathologic and radiologic features of suppurative osteomyelitis, a close inspection of the vascular anatomy is essential. The radiologic and pathologic features of osteomyelitis differ in the infant, child, and adult. These differences are inherent to the blood supply of the various vital centers of growth within the bone. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F1-12">Fig. 12-1</a>)</div>

<div class="HD"><span class="emph_I">Infantile Pattern.</span></div>
<div class="P">In infants the fetal vascular compartment may persist in some tubular bones up to the age of 1 year. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R6-12">6</a>) As a result of this persistence, metaphyseal and diaphyseal vessels may penetrate the physis (growth plate). Trueta (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R15-12">15</a>) found that the vascular barrier at the growth plate became evident at the age of 8 months and was fully formed by the 18th month. Until the age of 8 months, the physis forms no effective barrier to the spread of infection into the epiphyses and the joint. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R15-12">15</a>) This anatomic relationship explains the high incidence of septic arthritis with epiphyseal involvement in infantile osteomyelitis.

<div class="P">In the adult, the metaphyseal vessels gradually penetrate the vanishing physis, re-establishing communication between the metaphysis and the subarticular end of the bone (previously the epiphysis).

<div class="HD">Pathophysiology</div>
<div class="P">Hematogenous osteomyelitis begins in the bone with implantation of the offending organism, usually in the medullary tissues, followed by a vascular and cellular response. Initially, the localized suppurative edema creates an increased intramedullary pressure, resulting in mechanical compression of the capillaries and sinusoids in the marrow cavity. This precipitates infarction of marrow fat, hematopoietic tissue, and bone. Adjacent to the marginal area of infarction there is active hyperemia, as is the case in other soft tissue infarction. The hyperemia is accompanied by osteoclastic activity, which causes focal osteolysis and regional osteoporosis. An inflammatory exudate forms at the margin of the infarct.</div>
<div class="P">Eventually, the inflammatory process penetrates the endosteum (inner cortex) and enters the Haversian and lacunar systems of the bone to reach the subperiosteal space. This process occurs readily in infants because they have few Sharpey&#x2019;s fibers and the periosteum is easily stripped from the bone. This produces exuberant periostitis, owing to the increased pressure in the subperiosteal space. The involvement of periosteal and subperiosteal areas causes a loss of blood supply to the cortical bone, rendering it necrotic. Cortical and medullary infarcts result in the formation of a <span class="emph_I">sequestrum,</span> or dead bone (Latin: &#x201C;to set apart&#x201D;). (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F2-12">Fig. 12-2</a>) A ring sequestrum may complicate pin tract osteomyelitis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R16-12">16</a>) The sequestered bone fragments are usually removed by osteoclasts when small; larger fragments may require surgical removal. As the pus lifts the periosteum, it causes a modest degree of new

bone proliferation and pain. The periosteal new bone is the body&#x2019;s attempt to wall off the infective process. This bony collar is often referred to as an <span class="emph_I">involucrum</span> (Latin: &#x201C;to wrap or cover&#x201D;). (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F2-12">Fig. 12-2</a>) The thick bony sleeve usually envelops the affected segment of the shaft; and in cases of extensive lesions, almost the entire shaft may become encased in involucrum.</div>

<div class="P">The occurrence of a defect that may develop in the involucrum is referred to as a <span class="emph_I">cloaca</span>.

A 20- to 30-year latent period is typical from the onset of osteomyelitis to the development of neoplasm (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R6-12">6</a>), thus regular biopsies should be performed on all chronic ulcers for early diagnosis and detection of malignant degeneration.

<div class="P">In more chronic forms of osteomyelitis a thickened irregular cortex and dense sclerotic bone may surround the focal areas of osteolytic destruction.

<div class="HD">Soft Tissue Alterations</div>
<div class="P">Often the earliest radiologic signs of infection involve the soft tissues rather than bone. These signs may be seen within 3 days of the bacterial contamination of the bone. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R27-12">27</a>) Swelling of the deep soft tissues, usually around the metaphysis in infants and children, may be the earliest radiographic sign. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R6-12">6</a>) (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F7-12">Fig. 12-7</a>) Such swelling often elevates the lucent fat planes from the adjacent bone. The adjacent edema and cellulitis of the soft tissues will slowly begin to obliterate the myofascial marginal planes. These changes occur in the deep myofascial structures first and then affect the more superficial levels. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R27-12">27</a>) These soft tissue changes are more difficult to appreciate in the adult. If the soft tissue swelling is immense, it may resemble the mass-like density of a soft tissue neoplasm. The neoplasm, however, displaces and deforms the soft tissue margins without obliterating them, making differentiation possible. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R28-12">28</a>)</div>

Its extension across the growth plate depends on the patient&#x2019;s age. Eventually, large medullary destructive osteolytic lesions occur, which often reach the cortex. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F10-12">Fig. 12-10</a>) Bone sequestrum formation appears 3-6 weeks after the initial onset of symptoms. These necrotic fragments actually retain their original radiographic density. As a result, they appear sclerotic relative to the adjacent osteopenic bone. With cortical disruption, the purulent exudate gains access to the soft tissues through the cloaca.</div>

(<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R28-12">28</a>) Significant lifting of the periosteum by pus not only creates a laminated response but, with continued periosteal new bone production, a large involucrum may occur. This involucrum is composed of more rapidly formed woven bone and is, therefore, less dense radiographically. As a result, there is a radiographic contrast between dense infarcted sequestrum and the less dense involucrum. Once the infection has been treated and subsides, this involucrum will be remodeled and resorbed, leaving only a minor alteration in contour near the original site of the infection.</div>

Often, the white blood cell count is normal or only minimally elevated in patients with spinal disease. Elevated white blood cell counts are more common when there is appendicular involvement. Owing to the absence of fever and the ability to reproduce the pain mechanically, the incidence of misdiagnosis in patients with vertebral osteomyelitis is estimated at approximately 33&#x0025;.

<div class="HD"><span class="emph_I">Radiologic Patterns in Children and Adults.</span></div>
<div class="P">The age of the patient determines location, rate of spread, and thus the radiologic features of spondylitis. In children &#x003C; 20 years of age the vascular channels to the disc still exist and provide a pathway for disc infection before vertebral disease. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R4-12">4</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R6-12">6</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R29-12">29</a>) With initial disc involvement there is a narrowing of the overall disc height. This is usually associated with paraspinal edema (abscess formation). Eventually, the vertebral endplate is destroyed, creating patchy areas of osteolysis throughout the vertebral body.</div>
<div class="P">In adults the initial focus occurs at the anterior vertebral endplate. This appears as an area of radiolucency and irregularity. The vertebral endplate contains vascular channels, which allow nutrition of the intervertebral disc and also provide a site for entry of septic microemboli. Because the adult disc is avascular, organisms frequently lodge in the low-flow end-organ vascular arcades adjacent to the subchondral plates and involve the discs secondarily. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F12-12">Fig. 12-12</a>) Vertebral destruction and collapse ensues, with soft tissue paraspinal swelling.

<div class="P">Brodie&#x2019;s abscess was first described by Brodie in 1832. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R43-12">1</a>) It is defined as a localized, aborted form of suppurative osteomyelitis. The classic clinical presentation is that of localized limb pain, which is often nocturnal and dramatically alleviated by aspirin. This mimics the typical presenting symptoms of patients with osteoid osteoma. Patients often have a history of recent distant infection or have even undergone dental surgery that has <span class="emph_I">seeded</span> to bone. Brodie&#x2019;s abscess is most common in male children. The metaphyses of the tubular bones are most commonly affected, particularly the distal tibia, proximal tibia, distal femur, proximal or distal fibula, and distal radius (listed in decreasing order of incidence). (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F20-12">Figs. 12-20</a> and <a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F21-12">12-21</a>) Less frequently seen is Brodie&#x2019;s abscess affecting the diaphyses of tubular bones or flat bones.

<div class="P">The abscess lies within a bone cavity that is incarcerated by a wall of inflammatory granulation tissue. The adjacent spongy bone becomes sclerotic. The cavity contains necrotic debris and purulent or mucoid fluid (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R45-12">3</a>) from which the offending microorganism may or may not be cultured. <span class="emph_I">Staphylococcus aureus</span> is the most common bacterial agent to be isolated. Often, the abscess is sterile and no microorganisms can be found. Pathologically, a Brodie&#x2019;s abscess is often misdiagnosed as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis.

(<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R47-12">5</a>) As a differential point, the radiolucent nidus of osteoid osteoma is invariably &#x003C; 1.0 cm and may have a target center of calcification.

<div class="HD">CHILDHOOD INFLAMMATORY DISCITIS</div>
<div class="P">Childhood inflammatory discitis is separate and distinct from vertebral osteomyelitis. Synonyms for this entity include non-specific spondylitis, discitis, spondyloarthritis, and childhood intervertebral disc infection. Because these patients do not have a history of vertebral osteomyelitis or an iatrogenic inoculation, a separate pathway must exist for childhood inflammatory discitis. The discal blood supply persisting in individuals up to 20 years of age provides pathogens direct access to the disc. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R71-12">1</a>) Most authorities believe there is an infectious cause, even though organisms cannot always be isolated. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R72-12">2</a>) Post-traumatic fragmentation of the cartilaginous endplate has been suggested as a contributing factor. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R73-12">3</a>) The most common pathogen when cultured is <span class="emph_I">Staphylococcus aureus.</span> (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R72-12">2</a>)</div>
<div class="P">The age range of patients presenting with discitis is generally younger than those who present with osteomyelitis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R74-12">4</a>) Discitis may occur anywhere from 1 to 16 years of age (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R75-12">5</a>), with a mean of 3 years. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R74-12">4</a>) Males are more frequently afflicted. The clinical presentation is similar to childhood osteomyelitis but is usually less severe. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R74-12">4</a>) Constitutional symptoms consisting of a low-grade fever, anorexia, malaise, and irritability are to be expected. The young child with inflammatory discitis often refuses to walk, stand, or sit; the older child complains of back and hip pain. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R74-12">4</a>) The laboratory investigation shows an elevated ESR with a normal leukocyte count. Most children develop discitis following a variety of head and neck infections, which most commonly originate in the upper respiratory tract.</div>
<div class="P">Radiologic diagnosis is often delayed owing to the latent period of 3-4 weeks before roentgen signs are visible, even though the patient is symptomatic. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R76-12">6</a>) The most sensitive modality for early diagnosis is by nuclear bone scan; however, MRI and biopsy are usually performed to confirm the diagnosis and to guide treatment. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R76-12">6</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R77-12">7</a>) MRI will not differentiate pyogenic from tuberculous forms of spondylodiscitis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R78-12">8</a>) Common sites of involvement are the lumbar spine (75&#x0025;) and thoracic spine but rarely the cervical spine. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R72-12">2</a>) The earliest roentgen sign is disc space narrowing followed by fragmentation and destruction of the adjacent subchondral endplate. As the infectious process progresses, a significant degree of reactive subchondral endplate sclerosis will occur. The diagnosis is usually established by this stage, and antibiotic therapy will alter or halt this process. In some cases reversal of the vertebral bony and disc changes occurred within 34 months of therapy. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R79-12">9</a>) The posterior elements are usually spared.

<div class="HD">Pathologic Features</div>
<div class="P">Resnick and Niwayama (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R86-12">7</a>) suggested that during hematogenous spread of infection to a joint the organisms lodge within the vasculature of the synovial membrane, either indirectly from a distant infected source or directly from an adjacent bone infection. Thus infection of the synovial membrane precedes contamination of the synovial fluid. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R86-12">7</a>) With the accumulation of purulent exudate, capsular distention will occur. This distention may interfere with the normal cartilage nutrition, leading to the death of large numbers of chondrocytes. As the acute inflammatory cells and cartilage cells disintegrate, they release proteolytic enzymes from their cytoplasm, and progressive destruction of the articular surface ensues. Continued joint effusion and distention, coupled with destruction of cartilage and bone, cause eventual dislocation. This is especially true in the hip joint of a newborn but may also occur in the adult hip in an advanced stage of the infective process. Continued use of the joint results in a rapid disintegration from mechanical disturbances, resulting in total loss of articular joint space.</div>
<div class="P">Eventually, the subchondral bone is penetrated and destruction of the articular cortex occurs. Regional hyperemia causes extensive juxta-articular osteoporosis, which is augmented by disuse of the joint. Greater destruction of the bone becomes evident, and a late sequela may be bony or fibrous ankylosis of the joint. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F30-12">Fig. 12-29</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Rarely, gas formation may be seen in septic arthritis. This gas is usually intra-articular but may also be found in the juxta-articular soft tissue.

This measurement is taken from the lateral aspect of K&#x00F6;hler&#x2019;s teardrop to the medial margin of the femoral head; a measurement &#x003E; 11 mm or a difference in measurement &#x003E; 2 mm, compared with the opposite hip, is a positive sign and is considered clinically significant. It should be noted that Waldenstr&#x00F6;m&#x2019;s sign is a non-specific sign of joint effusion, is not pathognomonic of infection, and may also occur in post-traumatic and synovial inflammatory cases.

<div class="P">The earliest skeletal roentgen sign of septic arthritis is the loss of the normal subchondral cortical bone (subarticular white line). (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F37-12">Fig. 12-36</a>) Radiographs of optimum quality are necessary for demonstrating this sign, along with a high degree of observer suspicion. As the infective process progresses, medullary metaphyseal moth-eaten destruction occurs. If this becomes extensive, it could lead to complete resorption of the articulating ends of the bones. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F38-12">Figs. 12-37</a> and <a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F39-12">12-38</a>) A laminated periosteal response (extracapsular in origin) may be seen as the destructive lesion disrupts the outer cortex and irritates the periosteum. A late sequela may be complete ankylosis, bony or fibrous, of the affected joint (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F40-12">Fig. 12-39</a>).</div>
<div class="P">As the infection subsides, the articular surface may be remodeled but invariably is left deformed. During healing, remineralization gradually reestablishes discrete bone margins. If the infection has progressed this far, however, one can expect little restoration of articular spacing. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F41-12">Fig. 12-40</a>)</div>
<div class="P">The time frame in which these roentgen signs and pathologic processes occur is reasonably short in suppurative septic arthritis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F42-12">Fig. 12-41</a>) This is in contrast to the extended time sequence so frequently encountered in non-suppurative granulomatous (tubercular) arthritis.</div>

<div class="P">For nearly 5,000 years tuberculosis was a lethal bone disorder. During the Industrial Revolution, urban overcrowding, malnutrition, and debilitation produced an environment in which tuberculosis became epidemic in the Western world. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R94-12">1</a>) At the beginning of the 20th century tuberculosis was the leading cause of death in Western society. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R95-12">2</a>) In previous times there were two modes of infection: inhalation and ingestion. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R96-12">3</a>) Infection by ingestion was typical for the bovine tubercle bacillus <span class="emph_I">Mycobacterium bovis,</span> and this type was responsible for a significant number of the cases of bone and joint tuberculosis.
<a name="PG1399"> </a><div class="pagenum"><div>P.1399</div></div>
<br clear="all">
This form of tuberculosis has largely been eradicated. Nearly all tuberculous infections in the United States are caused by the human strain of <span class="emph_I">Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</span>
</div>
<div class="P">With the emergence of effective chemotherapeutic agents in the late 1940s and early 1950s for management of tuberculosis, it is now considerably less common in the United States and United Kingdom than in the first half of the 20th century. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R97-12">4</a>) However, it is estimated that one third of the world&#x2019;s population is a carrier of the bacillus (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R98-12">5</a>), and with the advent of modern travel and the immigration to the Western world of various ethnic groups susceptible to tuberculosis, the condition is still seen with some frequency in the large population centers of the Western countries. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R97-12">4</a>) More than 10 million people in the United States alone are currently infected. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R99-12">6</a>) Similarly, in many countries of Asia and Africa, which are characterized by substandard conditions of healthcare, inadequate diet, and even semistarvation, the incidence of skeletal tuberculosis remains high. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R97-12">4</a>) In addition, evidence accumulates that the organism is developing a degree of resistance to the antibiotics that have been so singularly effective in recent years. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R97-12">4</a>) Infection of the musculoskeletal system is commonly caused by hematogenous spread of a primary focus within the respiratory tract. The thoracic and lumbar spine are favored skeletal sites. Although once thought to be a disease of childhood, patients of all ages now seem to be susceptible.</div>

<div class="P">In 1953, 84,203 cases of tuberculosis were reported in the United States.

(<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R100-12">7</a>) The incidence of tuberculosis in the United States appears to be stabilizing, with isolated areas of disease still existing among the socioeconomically disadvantaged and among recent immigrants from geographic areas where the disease is still endemic. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R101-12">8</a>) Because it is considered uncommon, tuberculosis is frequently overlooked in the differential diagnosis of the unknown spinal lesion. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R101-12">8</a>) This lack of appreciation of spinal tuberculosis contrasts with the large number of papers now appearing on primary spinal bone tumors.

<div class="P">Skeletal tuberculosis is estimated to affect only 2&#x0025; of patients with tuberculosis (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R102-12">9</a>) and probably occurs only in immunodeficient patients after massive exposure to this primarily respiratory pathogen. In individuals such as prepubertal children, debilitated geriatrics, AIDS sufferers, silicosis, lymphoma patients, alcoholics, and drug abusers, tuberculosis often has an accelerated rate of progress. Unlike pyogenic osteomyelitis, tuberculous osteomyelitis tends to arise insidiously and takes a chronic course that can be destructive and resistant to control.</div>
<div class="P">Skeletal tuberculosis is most prevalent in the first three decades and most frequently seen in prepubertal children, though it is exceedingly rare during the 1st year of life. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R103-12">10</a>) There is no sex predilection. The onset of symptoms is generally insidious and not accompanied by alarming general manifestations such as fever, night sweats, toxicity, or prostration. Pain in the region of the involved joint may be mild at onset and accompanied by a sensation of stiffness. Tuberculous spondylitis presents clinically with an insidious onset of back pain, decreased range of motion, and focal tenderness. This spinal pain may be with or without neurological involvement. The sudden onset of lower limb paraplegia in spinal tuberculosis is referred to as <span class="emph_I">Pott&#x2019;s paraplegia.</span> In advanced cases, the patients complain of a pus-draining sinus tract. In children, 70&#x0025; of patients are &#x2264; 5 years of age, and the duration of symptoms before treatment averages 1-2 years. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R104-12">11</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Appendicular tubercular arthritis presents clinically with tenderness, soft tissue swelling, joint effusion, and increased skin temperature around the involved area. As the disease progresses, limitation of joint motion becomes marked because of muscle contractures. Eventually, muscle atrophy and deformity become apparent. Because the knee and hip are the most common sites, patients often develop a limp as a mechanism to protect the involved weight-bearing joint. The articulations of the lower extremities are more frequently involved than are those of the upper extremities.</div>

<div class="HD">Tubercular Spondylitis (Pott&#x2019;s Disease)</div>
<div class="P">Tubercular spondylitis was recognized in ancient times, with descriptions noted for Egyptian mummies dating as far back as 3,000 B.C. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R105-12">12</a>) The original paper describing this disease was written by Percival Pott (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R106-12">13</a>) in 1779, and the condition is widely known as Pott&#x2019;s disease. It is estimated that the spine is affected in 25-60&#x0025; of cases of skeletal tuberculosis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R107-12">14</a>) The most common sites are the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine, with L1 being the favored segment of involvement. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R107-12">14</a>) The concept of vascular dissemination is well established. Most authorities agree that it spreads via the venous pathway of Batson&#x2019;s plexus. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R108-12">15</a>)</div>

<div class="P">The adult intervertebral disc is avascular; therefore, pathogens reach the disc via an alternative route. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F12-12">Fig. 12-12</a>) Contrary to previous belief, the subchondral vertebral endplate is the earliest site for this infectious focus. Even though disc space narrowing is often the earliest radiographic sign, the initial pathologic focus lies within the anterior vertebral endplate. The infecting organisms travel as emboli via the bloodstream until they block the conducting arterioles or venules. The vascular network of looping redundant vessels at the anterior aspect of the vertebral body creates an opportune environment for organisms to lodge and proliferate. As caseous necrosis ensues, an identifiable lytic vertebral abnormality will be seen in 2-5 months. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R109-12">16</a>) This weakens the vertebral endplate considerably, creating an alternative mechanism for infectious spread to the disc.

<div class="HD">Tubercular Arthritis</div>
<div class="P">Tuberculosis involving the weight-bearing appendicular joints is second only to the preferred spinal site. The hip and knee are the most common sites (representing 75&#x0025; of cases), with the ankle, shoulder, elbow, pubes, and wrist being rarely involved. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R97-12">4</a>) (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F52-12">Figs. 12-51</a> and <a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F53-12">12-52</a>) Monoarticular involvement is the rule. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R107-12">14</a>) Most patients are middle-aged or elderly, and many have received multiple intra-articular injections of steroids for a pre-existing unrelated joint disorder. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R107-12">14</a>)</div>
<div class="P">The tubercle bacillus may lodge in the synovium or the metaphyseal portion of the bone. Most tubercular arthritic lesions begin within the metaphysis as an infectious focus with secondary spread to the joint. With this mode of presentation the inflammatory changes in the synovial membrane are extensive, leading to significant early joint effusion. The infected synovial membrane becomes thickened, and granulation tissue spreads to the free surface of the articular cartilage. This interference with the free surface of the articular cartilage affects its nutrition and ultimately leads to its destruction. Early erosions occur involving the portion of the proximal femur that is bare of cartilage but exposed to synovium. Thus the initial erosive lesions may simulate those of early rheumatoid arthritis. As the entire infective process progresses, a non-uniform destruction of the articular surface occurs. As cartilage and bone destruction ensue, sequestrum formation of variable size may occur. This process often involves both surfaces of the joint, leading to the characteristic <span class="emph_I">kissing sequestrum.</span> (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R97-12">4</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R107-12">14</a>) (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F54-12">Fig. 12-53</a>)</div>

<div class="P">Often, a triad (<span class="emph_I">Phemister&#x2019;s triad</span>) of radiographic findings exists and is characteristic of tuberculous arthritis: progressive and slow joint space narrowing, juxta-articular osteoporosis, and peripheral erosive defects of the articular surfaces. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R107-12">14</a>) (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F66-12">Fig. 12-65</a>)</div>

(<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R107-12">14</a>) These corner marginal erosions occur early and may often simulate the erosions of rheumatoid arthritis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R107-12">14</a>) Rarely, periostitis will occur, creating a solid or laminated pattern. Periosteal new bone formation is much more common in pyogenic arthritis.</div>
<div class="P">The end stage of tubercular arthritis is fibrous ankylosis of the joint. Bony ankylosis is rare in tuberculosis, but it is a common sequela of pyogenic arthritis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#F67-12">Fig. 12-66</a>) A peculiar complication of tubercular arthritis in the knee is a focal overgrowth of the medial epiphysis, creating a <span class="emph_I">megacondyle,</span> as a result of localized hyperemia. This sometimes mimics a similar appearance of the medial condyle in Still&#x2019;s disease and hemophilia.</div>

<div class="P">Occasionally, tubercular arthritis can affect the sacroiliac joints, creating significant destruction on both sides of the joint. The presentation is usually unilateral.

<div class="P">Tubercular osteomyelitis of the long bones is uncommon. Focal bone destruction, usually in the metaphysis, along with severe osteoporosis, is noted. There is little or no periosteal reaction. Occasionally, the process may resemble pyogenic osteomyelitis, and a definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis often is impossible from plain films alone. Because of the chronicity of the disease, atrophy of surrounding soft tissues ensues. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#T3-12">Table 12-3</a>)</div>

<div class="HD">Scrofula (Mycobacterial Lymphadenitis)</div>
<div class="P">Scrofula is lymphadenopathy in response to a mycobacterial infection. The word has derivatives from Latin and French, meaning &#x201C;glandular swelling&#x201D; and &#x201C;full-necked sow,&#x201D; respectively. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R121-12">1</a>) Recognition of scrofula as a disease was perhaps first made by Herodotus in 400 B.C., who suggested that those with the &#x201C;scrofula-like&#x201D; illness should be isolated from others. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R121-12">1</a>) Scrofula later became known as <span class="emph_I">the king&#x2019;s evil</span> and was said to only be cured by &#x201C;the royal touch&#x201D; of monarchs. This ceremonious healing ritual took place in England until the death of King Charles II in 1682. Albucasis, on the other hand, documented surgical excision techniques for treating scrofula as early as A.D. 1000. A professor at Leyden University in the Netherlands was first to link scrofula with pulmonary tuberculosis, and Robert Koch, in 1882, identified the tubercle bacillus. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R121-12">1</a>)</div>

<div class="P">The incidence of syphilis (lues) has decreased steadily since the early part of the 20th century owing to the advent of penicillin therapy after World War II. However, between 1980 and 1990 there was a reappearance of syphilitic disease. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R146-12">1</a>) The causative organism, <span class="emph_I">Treponema pallidum,</span> is a slender spirochete found in early lesions.

Currently, a more accurate assessment using immunofluorescent antigen testing is available. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R147-12">2</a>) Treponemes are seldom seen in advanced lesions. The basic lesion of syphilis is an angiitis of the vasa vasorum or small arterioles. This endarteritis produces necrosis of the vessel wall, with subsequent infarction of the tissue supplied by the vessel. The end result is a gumma that consists of areas of coagulative necrosis surrounded by an infiltrate of plasma cells and leukocytes. Skeletal syphilis presents as either a congenital or an acquired lesion of bone.</div>

(<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R150-12">5</a>) The disease is transmitted from the mother to child via the placenta, and the transmission is rare before the 4th month of gestation because the Langhans layer of the chorion presents a barrier to the passage of the pathogen. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R151-12">6</a>) Spirochetemia in the mother results in intrauterine infection during the 5th or 6th month of pregnancy.

<div class="HD"><span class="emph_I">Phase 1: Metaphysitis.</span></div>
<div class="P">The first phase is present at birth or shortly thereafter. The lodging of spirochetes beneath the fetal growth plates produces a metaphysitis in which the normal vascular fountain underneath the cartilage is replaced by syphilitic granulation tissue. Bone formation and remodeling in the zone of primary ossification is, therefore, decreased or absent. This process creates radiolucent metaphyseal bands, which may be broad and&#x002F;or horizontal, occasionally mimicking the lucent bands in leukemia or metastatic disease from neuroblastoma.

Metaphyseal lesions often allow epiphyseal separation, most commonly affecting the upper extremity. The epiphyseal centers are rarely affected because the epiphyseal cartilage is avascular and the organisms are unable to gain access to this region. Therefore, the formation and maturation of cartilage is not affected by the spirochete.</div>
<div class="P">The knees, shoulders, and wrists are the most commonly affected areas.

<div class="HD">General Considerations</div>
<div class="P">Most fungal infections of the skeletal system are secondary to a primary infection, either of the respiratory system or from direct extension of an infected devitalized soft tissue focus. Occasionally, hematogenous seeding of skeletal structures may occur. Mycotic osteomyelitis actually represents a very small percentage of all bone infections. There is no characteristic clinical picture to allow adequate differential diagnosis among the varied fungal disorders or tuberculosis. The definitive diagnosis depends on culture studies of synovial fluid or tissue obtained from the local lesion.</div>
<div class="P">The fungi that may affect bone are <span class="emph_I">Coccidioides, Candida, Aspergillus, Actinomyces, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus</span> (<span class="emph_I">torula</span>), <span class="emph_I">Nocardia,</span> North and South American <span class="emph_I">Blastomyces, Sporothrix, Phycomyces</span> (<span class="emph_I">mucor, rhizopus</span>), and <span class="emph_I">Monosporium</span> (<span class="emph_I">mycetoma</span>).

<div class="HD">COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS</div>
<div class="P">Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by the fungus <span class="emph_I">Coccidioides immitis.</span> In the southwestern United States the disease is endemic, particularly in southern California (San Joaquin Valley), southern Arizona, and New Mexico. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R165-12">1</a>) The incidence of the disease is sharply increasing, (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R166-12">2</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R167-12">3</a>), especially among the elderly (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R168-12">4</a>) and immunocompromised. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R166-12">2</a>) Skeletal coccidioidomycosis is usually secondary to respiratory infection. The fungus is an inhabitant of soil and is disseminated through dust. Following spore inhalation, an inflammatory consolidation takes place in the terminal bronchioles. There are two distinct phases of the disease. The primary phase is usually respiratory only, and the secondary phase (dissemination phase) results from bronchial ulceration and aspiration of the infected exudate, or by vascular spread of the pathogens. The clinical presentation may mimic tuberculosis, with multiple systems subject to infection (liver, spleen, lymph nodes, skin, kidneys, bone, and meninges). Most cases in the United States are isolated within the lung, indolent, low grade, and self-limiting. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R167-12">3</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R169-12">5</a>) However, in the disseminated form it can be serious, with the symptoms varying according to the distribution of the lesions. If widespread dissemination occurs, surgical d&#x00E9;bridement (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R170-12">6</a>) and&#x002F;or long-term antifungal therapy is usually prescribed. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R171-12">7</a>) A successful treatment regime is not based on a curative nature but rather on obtaining a state of remission. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R172-12">8</a>) The disease is often fatal (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R166-12">2</a>), and with survival, a lifelong risk of recurrence persists. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R170-12">6</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R173-12">9</a>) Black and Filipino patients seem to have a higher mortality rate than whites affected by coccidioidomycosis.

<div class="HD">Radiologic Features</div>
<div class="P">Bone involvement occurs in about 20&#x0025; of cases of the disseminated form of this disease. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R175-12">11</a>) The most common bones involved are the spine, pelvis, ribs, and long bones; however, any bone can be a target site. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R175-12">11</a>) Rarely, the bones of the hand (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R176-12">12</a>) and feet (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R177-12">13</a>) are affected. The infection tends to involve bony prominences, such as the tibial tubercle, medial and lateral malleolus, medial end of the clavicle, trochanters, acromion, patella, calcaneus, and olecranon. There are no characteristic radiologic criteria to allow definitive differential diagnosis. Radiologically, a well-demarcated lytic destruction occurs early, with some associated laminated periosteal response. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R178-12">14</a>) In fulminating cases, skeletal lesions tend to be disseminated and a bone scan may help identify the locations of the lesions. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R178-12">14</a>) Ultimately, cortical disruption occurs, and a moderate degree of sclerosis eventuates usually in the chronic or healing phases. Abscess formation with a draining sinus is common. Joint involvement occurs in approximately 17&#x0025; of cases, which is more frequent than once thought. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R178-12">14</a>) When present, joint involvement may simulate tubercular infectious arthritis.</div>
<div class="P">The roentgen signs of spinal coccidioidomycosis include a paraspinal mass (abscess formation) and clearly defined radiolucent lesions in the vertebral body, pedicles, lamina, and adjacent ribs with a relative sparing of the disc spaces. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R179-12">15</a>) Multiple vertebral involvement is the rule, with vertebral collapse being rare. Contiguous rib involvement is characteristic of this disease, as it presents in the spine. Psoas abscess formation may occur and will occasionally calcify. These psoas abscesses are indistinguishable from those that complicate spinal tuberculosis. The thoracic and lumbar areas are the target spinal sites. The radiographic diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is only a presumptive one because the lesions often resemble other types of osteomyelitis. Definitive diagnosis must be made by isolation of the pathogen.</div>

<div class="HD">ACTINOMYCOSIS</div>
<div class="P">The most common infective agents are <span class="emph_I">Actinomyces israelii</span> and <span class="emph_I">bovis.</span> These agents are actually bacteria, not fungi, although traditionally they have been considered fungi by most physicians. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R180-12">1</a>) The pathogens are found in the mouth and bowel of normal individuals and usually cause no harm unless they are lodged in a region of devitalized tissue or penetrate deep into the tissues secondary to an operation or penetrating wound. Recent studies have also suggested that actinomycosis may present as an opportunistic organism secondarily to osteoradionecrosis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R181-12">2</a>) There are two major clinical forms of actinomycosis: the <span class="emph_I">cervicofacial type</span> and the <span class="emph_I">chest</span> and <span class="emph_I">abdominal</span> varieties. The abdominal presentation (ileocecal region) is uncommon; however, pulmonary involvement may be found in 15&#x0025; of the patients. Cervicofacial involvement is the most common clinical presentation, and poor oral hygiene is an associated factor. Since the organisms normally reside in the nasal and oral cavities, the high incidence of face and neck involvement is not surprising. Diagnosis is made by biopsy (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R181-12">2</a>) and the condition requires specific antibiotic therapy with possible surgical debridement.

<div class="HD">Radiologic Features</div>
<div class="P">Osseous actinomycosis is usually caused by direct extension from an adjacent long-standing soft tissue infection. Rarely, hematogenous spread acts as the mode of dissemination. An osseous lesion occurs in 15&#x0025; of cases. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R180-12">1</a>) The most common bones involved are the mandible, spine, ribs, and pelvis. Mandibular destruction is the most commonly encountered skeletal lesion. This usually follows a tooth extraction or socket infection (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R183-12">4</a>). The characteristic radiographic appearance is that of a lytic destructive lesion, often at the angle of the mandible, with little or no reactive new bone.

<br clear="all">
Abscess formation and draining sinuses are frequently found associated with the mandibular lesions.</div>
<div class="P">In vertebral column disease the original infective focus often stems from the adjacent retroperitoneal or mediastinal lymph nodes. Several vertebrae are usually involved, with lytic destruction and an occasional area of sclerosis. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R183-12">4</a>) The intervertebral disc is often spared and of normal height. (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R183-12">4</a>) The thoracic and lumbar spine are favored sites. The neural arch is often involved, and contiguous rib involvement is the rule when the thoracic spine is involved. Paravertebral abscesses may occur (<a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#R184-12">5</a>) but are usually smaller than those of tuberculosis and do not calcify. In some cases the vertebral bodies react like the ribs and thicken by periosteal new bone formation, producing a <span class="emph_I">&#x201C;sawtooth&#x201D;</span> outline to the vertebral body.

The early osseous lesions are poorly defined and limited to a few sites. In most cases, the eventual picture is that of widespread lytic destructive lesions. With advanced destruction, a bizarre filiform or undulating deformity of the osseous structures ensues. Fistulae formation is common, whereas periosteal reaction is minimal, and sequestration is rare. In advanced cases nearly all of the bones of the foot may be involved, with diffuse intra-articular osseous ankylosis occurring as a sequela. Very few other disease entities will affect so many bones of the entire foot. Neurotrophic arthropathy, particularly in diabetic patients, may destroy nearly all the tarsal bones, giving a similar appearance.
