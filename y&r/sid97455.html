<div class="TLV1 TLV1-noHD " id="B01382540.0-12" id_xpath="/OVIDBOOK[1]/METADATA[1]/FRTXT[4]/TLV1[1]">
<div class="P">As the saying goes, &#x201C;The third time is the charm.&#x201D; In skeletal radiology, the third edition of <span class="emph_I">Yochum and Rowe&#x2019;s Essentials of Skeletal Radiology</span> will become the gold standard.</div>
<div class="P">It is no easy task to improve upon a work that has received acclaim worldwide but this third edition does more than improve upon the second edition. With its expanded material and featured new chapter, &#x201C;Masqueraders of Musculoskeletal Disease,&#x201D; this third edition brings together inside a single cover all one needs to know to be an effective skeletal radiologist and clinician. If by some circumstance all skeletal radiology texts were burned to ashes, this edition would be a stand-alone, worthy of the risk and sacrifice required to preserve it from the fires of ignorance.</div>
<div class="P">Chiropractic representatives invited to write a foreword are proud that such a well-used text has arisen from within our own ranks. The authors have distinguished themselves as radiologists in both the chiropractic profession and the medical profession. They have worked with, walked with, and talked on the same programs with the world&#x2019;s greatest. We hope the chiropractic profession recognizes the great contribution they have made, not only to the practice of skeletal radiology but to enhance the image of chiropractic.</div>
<div class="P">We have been close enough to the action to know that creating this third edition has been a monumental task. The same commitment of sweat and tears that went into the first and second editions are evident between the lines and around every picture on every page. If any errors are present, it can only be blamed on computers.</div>
<div class="P">The golden thread that weaves this third edition together, strengthening the authors&#x2019; skill in conveyance of subject matter, is their love of teaching. They are master teachers, and their skill in holding an audience on the front of the seat in a darkened conference room has been incorporated into this lively text. Whether or not skeletal radiology is your love, <span class="emph_I">Essentials</span> will become your nightly reading companion.</div>
<div class="P">We salute the work of these great teachers with Lee Iacocca&#x2019;s sentiment:</div>
<div class="QT">
<div class="P">In a completely rational society, the best of us would aspire to be teachers and the rest of us would have to settle for something less, because passing civilization along from one generation to the next ought to be the highest honor and the highest responsibility anyone could have.</div>
