<div class="HD">HEMATOLOGIC DISORDERS</div>
<div class="P">Numerous blood-related disorders, including various anemias, leukemias, lymphomas, and clotting-deficient diseases (hemophilia), can cause skeletal alterations. Of all the various types of anemias, only those that are chronic and severe will result in radiographically visible osseous changes. Observable skeletal alterations are either related to direct effects of the disorders on the bone marrow or are secondary to complications inherent in the disease. The most notable osseous changes are seen in the congenital hemolytic anemias, especially thalassemia (Cooley&#x2019;s anemia), sickle cell anemia, and hereditary spherocytosis. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R1-13">1</a>) Chronic iron deficiency anemia produces minor skeletal changes, usually isolated to the skull. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R2-13">2</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R3-13">3</a>) Leukemia demonstrates characteristic changes largely dependent on age. Hemophilia primarily alters joint function because of recurrent intra-articular hemorrhage.

<div class="HD">General Considerations</div>
<div class="P">Sickle cell disease is a chronic, congenital, and hereditary hemolytic anemia. It was first described in 1910 by Herrick. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R4-13">1</a>) It is found almost exclusively in black individuals, representing the most common inherited disease among this population. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R5-13">2</a>) Less commonly, it is seen in certain Mediterranean populations. It is characterized pathologically by an abnormal molecular structure of hemoglobin that, under low oxygen tension, will distort the red blood cell into an elongated, curved, <span class="emph_I">sickle</span> configuration. The end result is increased hemolysis, vascular occlusion, and tissue anoxia. The osseous changes are primarily related to infarction, avascular necrosis, marrow hyperplasia, and retarded growth.</div>

<div class="HD">Clinical Features</div>
<div class="P">All individuals who possess the sickle cell hemoglobin (Hb) do not necessarily have symptoms or radiographic changes. Usually, only those that are homozygous (Hb SS) have symptoms, whereas those with other genotypes (Hb SA, Hb S-thalassemia) usually remain clinically silent. The disease currently affects an estimated 70,000 Americans. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R6-13">3</a>)</div>
<div class="P">The onset of clinical signs and symptoms in homozygous patients is usually after 6 months of age, owing to the progressive decrease in levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F). (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R7-13">4</a>) Weakness and pallor are usual but non-specific. Episodic abdominal crises, jaundice, acute bone pain, and dactylitis, however, particularly in a black individual, are characteristic clinical findings consistent with intermittent sickle-induced infarctions. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R8-13">5</a>) It is estimated that affected individuals will have approximately one acute painful episode per year; however, chronic pain syndromes are not uncommon with this condition. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R6-13">3</a>)</div>
<div class="P">A common symptom in infancy is the so-called <span class="emph_I">hand-foot syndrome.</span> This consists of painful swellings of the hands and feet and is the result of either infarction or <span class="emph_I">Salmonella</span> infection. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R9-13">6</a>) In general, there is a predisposition to develop <span class="emph_I">Salmonella</span> osteomyelitis, which at times will be bilateral and symmetric. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R10-13">7</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R11-13">8</a>) Within the skeleton, the major deleterious effect is the development of avascular necrosis of the femoral or humeral heads in 8-13&#x0025; of cases. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R12-13">9</a>) The incidence of femoral and humeral head necrosis is equal, but the incidence of postprosthesis failure is as much as 50&#x0025;. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R12-13">9</a>) (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#F1-13">Fig. 13-1</a>) Owing to the systemic nature of the disease, osteonecrosis is often seen bilaterally. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R13-13">10</a>) The prevalence of avascular necrosis of the hip increases as the age of the patient and duration of the disease increases.

<div class="HD">Pathologic Features</div>
<div class="P">The phenomenon of erythrocyte sickling is caused by an abnormal hemoglobin, Hb S. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R12-13">9</a>) The underlying molecular defect in homozygotes, Hb SS, is owing to the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the sixth position on the &#x03B2;-globulin chain. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R22-13">19</a>) In sickle cell hemoglobin C (Hb SC), lysine is substituted for glutamic acid in the sixth position of the &#x03B2;-globulin chain. There are various types of sickle cell disease, based on the gene combination. The true sickle cell individual is homozygous for the sickle cell gene (Hb SS). Other genetic variants of sickle cell disease that may result in bone changes are sickle cell trait (Hb SA), sickle cell hemoglobin C (Hb SC), and sickle cell thalassemia (Hb S-thalassemia). Sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) is found in 1-3&#x0025; of blacks, and occasional cases in whites have been reported in Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Sicily. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R23-13">20</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R24-13">21</a>) Sickle cell anemia occurs in 7-9&#x0025; of black Americans.</div>
<div class="P">The pathologic hallmark of sickle cell anemia is the transformation of a normal-appearing red blood corpuscle to the sickle configuration under local hypoxia. This <span class="emph_I">sickling phenomenon</span> results in increased mechanical fragility of the cell itself, increased blood viscosity, stasis, and lowered pH.</div>
<div class="P">The osseous changes in sickle cell hemoglobinopathies occur secondary to marrow hyperplasia, local ischemia, and necrosis. The result is an overall decrease in the number of bony trabeculae, thinning of the cortices, bone death, and growth deformities.</div>
<div class="P">In the developing spine, vascular compromise and regional ischemia result in a unique vertebral body endplate configuration (<span class="emph_I">fish vertebrae, step-down sign, H vertebra, Reynolds&#x2019; phenomenon</span>).

artery. At the periphery of the endplates there is a diffuse network of anastomotic perforating vessels. This pattern of vascular distribution and circulatory dynamics results in ischemia of the central endplate zone when the nutrient artery becomes obstructed, such as in a <span class="emph_I">sickling crisis.</span> The peripheral vessels, because of their number and anastomoses, allow collateral circulation to develop more easily if they become obstructed. The result is the inhibition of growth of the central endplate zone, culminating in its relative inward displacement. The periphery remains unaffected, contributing to the development of the normal vertebral body height.</div>

<div class="P">The extent of marrow hyperplasia determines the degree of osseous changes. Even in the most severe forms of sickle cell disease the marrow response is significantly less than that seen in thalassemia, providing a reliable radiographic differential feature between the two entities.

<div class="P">Skeletal manifestations include generalized osteopenia, sparse and coarsened trabecular pattern, large vascular channels, widened medullary cavity, cortical thinning, and a loss of the diaphyseal constriction in the small tubular bones.

<div class="HD"><span class="emph_I">Infarction.</span></div>
<div class="P">The roentgen appearance of infarction depends on the time sequence, location, and extent of the infarction. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#T2-13">Table 13-2</a>) The earliest radiographic sign, especially in the tubular bones of the hands and feet, is initial soft tissue swelling, followed in about 2 weeks by diaphyseal and linear periostitis. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R8-13">5</a>) Ensuing rarefaction of the involved bone results in a radiologic presentation identical to that of osteomyelitis. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is unreliable in distinguishing between osteomyelitis and bone infarction. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R32-13">29</a>) The best method for differentiation is the combined use of technetium and gallium scintigraphy, by which both scans will show focal uptake in the presence of infection in contrast to infarctions, which show uptake of technetium but normal to low uptake of gallium. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R33-13">30</a>) MRI shows acute infarction as reduced signal on T1- and increased signal on T2-weighted studies.

<div class="P">Thalassemia (Cooley&#x2019;s anemia, Mediterranean anemia) is the world&#x2019;s most common hereditary disorder. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R47-13">1</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R48-13">2</a>) It is characterized by abnormal hemoglobin synthesis that produces variable degrees of anemia. The first description was by Cooley and Lee in 1925. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R49-13">3</a>) Most of the early reports were based on individuals of Mediterranean origin, from which the term <span class="emph_I">thalassemia</span> (&#x201C;the sea&#x201D;) has been derived. In addition to its occurrence in Greek and Italian populations, the disease has also been recorded in Turkey, Syria, India, the Philippines, and Thailand; there are also reports in Native Americans and blacks. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R50-13">4</a>) The different genetic varieties of thalassemia produce a series of disorders known collectively as the <span class="emph_I">thalassemia syndromes.</span> However, three general groups have been identified, classified according to the severity of the disease: thalassemia major, thalassemia minor, and thalassemia intermedia. The most severe form is thalassemia major, which has the poorest prognosis. The effects on the skeleton can be severe and manifest radiographically as signs of increased marrow hemopoiesis.</div>

(<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R52-13">6</a>) Most frequently, arthralgia (30&#x0025;) and low back pain (25&#x0025;) are the major complaints. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R52-13">6</a>) The locomotor system is affected in 60&#x0025; of patients, and scoliosis can be identified in up to 40&#x0025; of cases. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R52-13">6</a>) In the major form survival beyond the first few years of life is unusual. Blood transfusions and chelation therapy are the current treatment options available. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R47-13">1</a>) However, repeated blood transfusions invariably result in hemochromatosis, with subsequent cardiac failure and death by the 2nd or 3rd decade of life. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R50-13">4</a>) Laboratory studies of the hepatic iron concentration is a reliable indicator in the assessment of total iron stores and hemochromatosis. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R53-13">7</a>) Recent advances in treatment have increased the survival rate to the 4th decade on average.

<div class="HD">Pathologic Features</div>
<div class="P">The genetic variations producing the abnormal hemoglobins are many. The most severe form (thalassemia major) is an expression of the homozygous genotype, whereas the more clinically benign form (thalassemia minor) is heterozygous. The essential defect is an imbalance in globin chain production (&#x03B1;- and &#x03B2;-chains), which leads to ineffective hemopoiesis, hemolysis, and anemia. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R57-13">11</a>) Diminished &#x03B1;- and &#x03B2;-chain production are termed &#x03B1;-thalassemia and &#x03B2;-thalassemia, respectively. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R58-13">12</a>) Thalassemic bone changes are a reflection of overgrowth and overactivity of marrow tissue, which generally is the most severe of all the anemias. In infants and children the entire skeleton is involved because of the presence of red marrow. With increasing age there may be regression of peripheral skeletal changes because the red marrow is normally replaced by fatty marrow. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R59-13">13</a>) In contrast, the pelvis, spine, and skull may show progression of changes with age. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R60-13">14</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Pathologic changes in bone relate directly to the erythroid hyperplasia, with marked widening of the medullary cavity, thinning of cortices, expansion in bone diameter, resorption of fine trabeculae, and thickening of remaining trabeculae. Extramedullary hemopoiesis results in hepatosplenomegaly and, in the posterior mediastinal paraspinal soft tissues, the development of hemopoietic masses. CT of these mediastinal masses has shown them to be derived from herniation of expanding bone marrow through the thinned trabeculae of the posterior ribs.

<div class="HD">General Considerations</div>
<div class="P">Hemophilia is the generic term applied to the group of blood coagulation disorders characterized by a deficiency of specific clotting factors. The two most common bleeding disorders associated with skeletal abnormalities are classic hemophilia (hemophilia A) and Christmas disease (hemophilia B). (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R78-13">1</a>) Both are sex linked, recessive, and inherited. Genetically, the female is the carrier, but usually the disorder manifests clinically only in the male. The radiographic features focus on the effects of hemorrhages within or around bones and joints as well as within visceral organs.</div>
</div>
<div class="TLV3" id="B01382540.0-4206" id_xpath="/OVIDBOOK[1]/TXTBKBD[1]/CHAPTER[13]/TBD[1]/TLV1[1]/TLV2[3]/TLV3[2]">
<div class="HD">Clinical Features</div>
<div class="P">There are varying degrees of clinical expression of the disease. Mild forms exist that may not demonstrate a significant bleeding tendency. The more severe forms are characterized by spontaneous bleeding or bleeding as a result of minor injuries. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R79-13">2</a>) The sites of hemorrhage vary, involving all body cavities, tissues, bones, and joints. It is estimated that 80&#x0025; of the bleeding occurs solely in the joints. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R80-13">3</a>) Rarely, hematomas occur in the muscle; however, when present loss of function and life-threatening complications are common. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R81-13">4</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Intraosseous hemorrhage results in a destructive and often expansile alteration, most frequently of the ilium and femur. Articular hemorrhages produce acute and chronic hemarthroses, which subsequently precipitate synovitis and permanent joint changes (hemophilic arthropathy) and are especially prevalent in the weight-bearing joints of the lower extremity. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R82-13">5</a>) (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#F11-13">Fig. 13-11</a>) Injection or radiation synovectomy is the treatment of choice, and chronic arthritic changes are usually inevitable.

(<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R84-13">7</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Current research is leading toward gene therapy for a viable treatment option in these patients. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R82-13">5</a>) Few trials of gene transfer therapy have been performed; however, in the limited results, safe and tolerated outcomes have been documented.

<div class="HD">Pathologic Features</div>
<div class="P">The basic coagulative defect most commonly is owing to a deficiency of factor VIII (antihemophilic factor; AHF) and results in classic hemophilia A. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R86-13">9</a>) In hemophilia B there is a lack of factor IX. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R86-13">9</a>) In the absence of either of these two coagulation factors, the blood-clotting mechanism is rendered non-functional and ineffective, predisposing the patient to severe, uncontrolled hemorrhage.</div>
<div class="P">Within joints, hemophilic hemorrhage, especially when recurrent, initiates a sequence of characteristic alterations. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R87-13">10</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R88-13">11</a>) Initial bleeding episodes may resolve completely with no sequelae. Repeated hemarthroses, however, eventually precipitate synovial proliferation (<span class="emph_I">pannus</span>) and synovial hemosiderin deposition. Articular adhesions and progressive fibrosis of the subsynovium, capsule, and periarticular tissues also occur. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R89-13">12</a>) Articular cartilage remains resistant to degradation by the synovial pannus for a long time, but eventually marginal erosions and degenerative changes ensue.

<div class="HD">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</div>
<div class="P">Leukemia is a malignant disease of the bone marrow and blood characterized by proliferating white blood cells. Various groups are recognized based on age, mode of onset, course, and major cell types. Essentially, those that occur with a rapid onset are classified as being acute and are more common in children, whereas those that begin more insidiously and follow a more lengthy course are called chronic. Histologically, three major cell types are evident: myeloid, lymphatic, and monocytic. Radiologically, various skeletal changes will be evident, especially in younger individuals and in those with more severe disease involvement.</div>

<div class="P">Acute leukemia is the most common malignant childhood disease. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R105-13">1</a>) Together, with the lymphomas, their incidence accounts for approximately 40&#x0025; of the malignant childhood diseases. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R106-13">2</a>) The peak incidence is between 2 and 5 years of age. The most common form is the acute lymphocytic type, which is usually fatal within 1 year. Clinically, generalized joint pain, weakness, lethargy, pallor, and loss of appetite are the major symptoms. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R107-13">3</a>) An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, pallor, and general malaise are usually evident on presentation. The definitive diagnosis is made by bone marrow evaluation; however, careful inspection of a peripheral blood smear may reveal excessive or very low white blood cell counts and the presence of immature cell forms.</div>

Clinically, the disorder affects middle-aged individuals. Fatigue, pallor, gouty symptoms, and generalized bone pain are prominent complaints. On physical examination notable splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are evident. Blood evaluation will demonstrate a normocytic, normochromic anemia, with immature red and white blood cells. A sternal puncture is usually unrewarding; however, an iliac crest biopsy will show the extensive fibrous replacement of the marrow elements.

<div class="P">Pathologic descriptions have largely been derived from examinations of necrotic femoral heads. Intra-articular epiphyses are anatomically predisposed to osteonecrosis because the majority of the blood supply is derived from vessels that penetrate through the joint capsule and lie in a subsynovial position on the external surface of the bone. These vessels are, therefore, susceptible to rupture or compression. Epiphyseal ischemic necrosis is a self-limiting disorder that will eventually heal. The entire process from initial infarction to healed deformity takes a variable time period, from 2 to 8 years.

<div class="HD">Metaphyseal-Diaphyseal Infarction</div>
<div class="P">The bones most frequently involved in a metaphyseal-diaphyseal infarction are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. Lesions are usually medullary in location. Radiographic features are initially lacking. Isotopic bone scans, however, will demonstrate increased uptake at the site. On MRI, a central high signal intensity zone is surrounded by a serpentine, thin, low signal border. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R155-13">33</a>) With revascularization, the necrotic bone is first seen as an area of generalized rarefaction, simulating an aggressive neoplasm. Later, as the infarct organizes and develops a peripheral rim of calcification (<span class="emph_I">mature infarct</span>), the lesion becomes more clearly delineated. Distinctively, the lesion is longer than it is wide and is usually located toward one end of the involved bone. The peripheral rim is dense, well demarcated, and undulating, creating a <span class="emph_I">serpiginous</span> configuration to the lesion. Internally, there may be areas of localized sclerosis. The adjacent cortex is unaffected. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#F25-13">Fig. 13-25</a>) Isotopic bone scans will show increased uptake even in mature infarcts. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#F26-13">Fig. 13-26</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Cortical infarctions are most frequent in the small peripheral tubular bones of the hands and feet, especially in young patients with sickle cell anemia. Within 10 days of the infarction, periostitis and localized foci of rarefaction are present. The cortex may appear split longitudinally. With time, the periostitis increases in thickness and may obliterate the normal diaphyseal constriction, giving the bone a rectangular appearance. Eventually, remodeling will reconstitute the normal bone contour. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#T14-13">Table 13-14</a>)</div>

<div class="HD">General Considerations</div>
<div class="P">Spontaneous (idiopathic) osteonecrosis of the femoral head is defined as bone death of the adult femoral head owing to ischemia of unknown cause. The first detailed description by Freund appeared in 1926. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R156-13">1</a>) In 1940, Chandler (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R157-13">2</a>) made reference to this disorder as &#x201C;coronary disease of the hip,&#x201D; which accounts for the eponym Chandler&#x2019;s disease. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R158-13">3</a>) On occasion this has also been called osteochondritis dissecans of the hip and adult avascular necrosis. Numerous other conditions can precipitate a similar clinical, pathologic, and radiologic presentation in the femoral head. These include alcoholism, trauma, hemoglobin abnormalities, and collagen disease. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#T15-13">Table 13-15</a>)</div>

<div class="TLV3" id="B01382540.0-4287" id_xpath="/OVIDBOOK[1]/TXTBKBD[1]/CHAPTER[13]/TBD[1]/TLV1[3]/TLV2[2]/TLV3[2]">
<div class="HD">Clinical Features</div>
<div class="P">There exists a definite (4:1) male predominance. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R159-13">4</a>) Most individuals present with necrosis between the ages of 30 and 70 years. Bilateral but asymmetric involvement of both femoral heads may be present in as many as 50&#x0025; of cases. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R160-13">5</a>) Symptoms initially may be vague and non-specific, consisting of pain in the buttock, groin, thigh, or knee. Usually, there is a gradual increase in intensity of the pain and decreased motion, especially in rotation and abduction. This occurs over several years, precipitating a limping gait and associated muscle atrophy. The initial presentation is commonly misinterpreted as radiating pain from the lumbar spine. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R161-13">6</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R162-13">7</a>) In the idiopathic form there is a distinct absence of antecedent trauma or known predisposing cause. Treatment is by replacement prosthesis. The use of core decompression has been advocated as a more conservative management alternative in early stages of the disease, although its efficacy is not certain.

striking. The necrotic area is distinctively a wedge-shaped region, with the apex directed centrally, involving the anterior superior weight-bearing region. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R160-13">5</a>) The fovea and inferior femoral head are unaffected. Fibrous tissue intervenes between the necrotic wedge and the sclerotic margin of the adjacent normal bone. Within the necrotic area fissures and cyst-like areas are present. Frequently, the articular cortex and its attached degenerating articular cartilage are separated from the necrotic segment.</div>

<div class="P">Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) is a disease of unknown origin affecting predominantly the medial condyle of the distal femur in adults. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R174-13">1</a>) It was first described by Ahlback et al. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R174-13">1</a>) in 1968. The medial condyle is most frequently affected; infrequently, the lateral condyle is affected, and rarely both simultaneously. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R175-13">2</a>) The medial tibial condyle is also a rare site for osteonecrosis.

(<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R179-13">6</a>) The same disorder can be initiated by other known, associated osteonecrotic factors, including steroid therapy, hemoglobinopathies, and transplantation. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R180-13">7</a>) Acute fracture rarely precipitates the condition. Spontaneous osteonecrosis differs distinctly from adolescent osteochondritis dissecans clinically, pathologically, and radiologically.

infarction. This phenomenon is most frequently encountered in individuals, such as deep sea divers, who are removed too rapidly from a high pressure environment.

<div class="P">Specific terms applied to the associated bone and joint abnormalities include dysbaric osteonecrosis, pressure-induced osteoarthropathy, and barotraumatic osteoarthropathy. The bone changes were first described by Bornstein and Plate and, independently, by Bassoe in 1911. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R189-13">1</a>)</div>

<div class="HD">Clinical Features</div>
<div class="P">Potential hazards of sudden atmospheric pressure changes have been well defined; however, increasing recreational, scientific, commercial, and military activities into altered pressure environments have focused renewed, justified attention on the disease. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R190-13">2</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R191-13">3</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R192-13">4</a>) As such, the most important clinical feature is to link the presence of signs and symptoms to previous barotrauma. In the acute phase, manifestations include altered neurological status; breathing difficulties; and severe muscle, joint, and bone pain. Later, changes are predominantly related to altered joint function from nitrogen bubble-induced epiphyseal necrosis. The incidence of this ischemic-induced bone disability may be as high as 60&#x0025; but is most likely to be found in 10-20&#x0025; of these predisposed individuals. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R193-13">5</a>) Physical findings of osteonecrosis include progressive joint pain, stiffness, and reduced motion, especially in the hips and shoulders. This frequently occurs bilaterally. Notably, a patient may have osteonecrosis and never have experienced an acute episode of decompression sickness.

<div class="HD">Pathologic Features</div>
<div class="P">The histopathologic characteristics of the osseous lesions are consistent with avascular necrosis. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R194-13">6</a>) The pathogenetic mechanism appears to be the formation of bloodborne nitrogen emboli, which impair tissue perfusion. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R191-13">3</a>) The origin of these nitrogen bubbles is related to Boyle&#x2019;s law concerning partial pressures of gases with altered atmospheric conditions. Under increased environmental pressure, such as in underwater diving, an individual&#x2019;s tissues become saturated with atmospheric gases. Fatty tissues, such as the bone marrow, spinal cord, and fat storage areas, are capable of absorbing five times more nitrogen than other tissue or blood plasma. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R195-13">7</a>) Decompression precipitates the dissolved tissue gases, which move back into the bloodstream for expulsion by the pulmonary capillary system. If the decrease in pressure occurs too quickly, nitrogen, in particular, will come out of its dissolved state to form bubbles in the fat-rich tissues, which can then embolize into small capillaries.</div>
<div class="P">Predisposing factors to Caisson&#x2019;s disease include obesity, repeated dysbaric episodes, exposure to greater pressures, and length of time spent in the altered pressure environment. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R190-13">2</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R196-13">8</a>) In divers the critical depth appears to be &#x003E; 30 m, below which there is a great increase in observable bone lesions.

<div class="P">Localization of nitrogen emboli within bone appears at two locations: fatty marrow and metaphyseal-epiphyseal regions. Osteonecrosis within the fatty marrow is evidenced by medullary diaphyseal-metaphyseal infarction. At the epiphysis region small end arteries are embolized, precipitating infarction, especially in the femoral and humeral heads. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R195-13">7</a>)</div>

<div class="HD">Radiologic Features</div>
<div class="P">Lesions of dysbaric osteonecrosis may occur unilaterally, bilaterally, or in any combination of sites. A radiologic skeletal survey of an individual suspected of harboring lesions of dysbaric necrosis should include AP views of the heads and proximal shafts of both humeri and femora, as well as AP and lateral views of both knees to include the distal two thirds of the femur and upper one third of the tibia. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R197-13">9</a>) An important aspect of the radiologic evaluation is the recognition of the long latent period, up to a number of years, before changes may become apparent.

<div class="HD">EPIPHYSEAL DISORDERS</div>
<div class="P">Few entities have had as diverse a terminology as epiphyseal necrosis. Multiple synonyms, such as osteochondritis, osteochondrosis, epiphysitis, aseptic necrosis, and avascular necrosis, represent attempts to classify the disorder according to anatomic site, cause, and pathologic alteration. Further confusion has arisen with the continued use of the many eponyms, reflecting name(s) of the individual(s) who described the disorder in a given epiphysis. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#F42-13">Fig. 13-42</a>; <a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#T20-13">Table 13-20</a>) Careful analysis of each of these epiphyseal abnormalities reveals three major groups: osteonecrosis (primary or secondary), trauma, and confusing growth variations.</div>

<div class="HD"><span class="emph_I">Primary and Secondary Osteonecrosis.</span></div>
<div class="P">Primary osteonecrosis is defined as bone death occurring in an epiphysis from an unknown cause. Secondary osteonecrosis is the same condition that occurs from a known cause, such as fracture, sickle cell anemia, corticosteroids, or Gaucher&#x2019;s disease. The most common sites are the femoral heads, humeral heads, distal femurs, metatarsal heads, and carpal lunate.</div>

<div class="HD"><span class="emph_I">Trauma.</span></div>
<div class="P">Fragmentation of part of an epiphysis from acute or chronic trauma simulates changes of ischemic necrosis but histologically lacks the characteristic changes. The best examples occur at the tibial tubercle (Osgood-Schlatter disease), medial tibia (Blount&#x2019;s disease), lower pole of the patella (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease), and spinal discovertebral junction (Scheuermann&#x2019;s disease).</div>

<div class="HD"><span class="emph_I">Growth Variants.</span></div>
<div class="P">Normal variations in ossification within growing epiphyses have inappropriately been attributed to ischemic necrosis. The most common locations for this confusing variation to occur are at the calcaneal apophysis (Sever&#x2019;s disease) and ischiopubic synchondrosis (van Neck&#x2019;s disease).</div>
<div class="P">In general, the most common age group for osteonecrosis is between 3 and 10 years of age. Males tend to be involved more frequently than females, and the disorders may be bilateral at times. Predisposing conditions are many, including thromboembolic disorders, vascular disease, and trauma. Commonly, a specific activity that creates abnormal stresses is associated. Clinical manifestations include localized and referred pain, swelling, reduced range of motion, and muscle atrophy. If the disorder is in a location involved in locomotion, a limp may be evident. Once the disease has run its self-limiting course, deformity of the joint surface and altered joint mechanics may result in chronic pain and disability, while predisposing the patient to premature degenerative joint disease.</div>

<div class="HD">General Considerations</div>
<div class="P">Legg-Calv&#x00E9;-Perthes disease is the synonym applied to avascular necrosis of the femoral capital epiphysis before closure of the growth plate. It was first recognized in the early 1900s separately by these three investigators. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R233-13">1</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R234-13">2</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R235-13">3</a>) The disorder represents true avascular necrosis of bone. It is self-limiting, resolving within 2-8 years but resulting in various degrees of deformity. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R236-13">4</a>)</div>
</div>
<div class="TLV4" id="B01382540.0-4357" id_xpath="/OVIDBOOK[1]/TXTBKBD[1]/CHAPTER[13]/TBD[1]/TLV1[4]/TLV2[4]/TLV3[1]/TLV4[2]">
<div class="HD">Clinical Features</div>
<div class="P">The disorder most frequently affects patients between the ages of 3 and 12 years, with peak incidence in the 5- to 7-year age group. Onset before the age of 4 years exhibits a better overall prognosis. The prognosis worsens with advancing age of onset. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R237-13">5</a>) A definite male predominance of 5:1 exists. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R238-13">6</a>) Approximately 10&#x0025; of the cases entail bilateral involvement, but this is rare in females. The condition is rare in blacks, and there is a familial incidence in 6-12&#x0025; of cases. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R236-13">4</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R239-13">7</a>) It has been suggested that with bilateral involvement the pathologic process of one hip does not influence the process of the other. It is believed that each hip develops and progresses through the disease process independently. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R240-13">8</a>)</div>
<a name="PG1463"> </a><div class="pagenum"><div>P.1463</div></div>
<br clear="all">
<div class="P">The clinical symptom picture includes vague groin pain, occasionally extending down into the anteromedial knee, and a limp. Motion of the involved hip, especially abduction and internal rotation, invariably produces pain, though these symptoms may be intermittent and inconsistent. Chronic cases may exhibit prominent atrophy of the thigh muscles. Previous trauma to the hip is often associated. Specific orthopedic tests, such as the Fabere-Patrick and Trendelenburg tests, may be positive. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R236-13">4</a>) If the patient is an adult who developed Legg-Calv&#x00E9;-Perthes disease as a child, additional findings consistent with secondary degenerative joint disease may be evident, including diminished and painful ranges of motion, flexion contracture, muscle atrophy, crepitus, a notably shortened limb, and increasing stiffness that is reduced upon walking.

<div class="HD">Pathologic Features</div>
<div class="P">The essential pathologic alterations are those consistent with avascular necrosis; however, the primary cause of the vascular disturbance remains obscure. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R242-13">10</a>) Legg believed trauma to be the cause; Calv&#x00E9;, rickets; and Perthes, infection. Presently, a number of factors have been implicated, including heredity, trauma, endocrine disorders, inflammation, nutrition, and altered circulatory hemodynamics. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R236-13">4</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R243-13">11</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R244-13">12</a>) Disturbed venous drainage and intraosseous hypertension are important factors. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R245-13">13</a>) In the majority of cases, the bone age is reduced by 50&#x0025; of the chronologic age. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R246-13">14</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R247-13">15</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Intensive investigations into the vascular anatomy of the developing femoral head have identified a vulnerable period between the ages of 4 and 7 years, corresponding to the average age of onset of the disorder. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R243-13">11</a>) The vascular supply to the femoral head is derived from three primary sources: (<span class="emph_I">a</span>) foveal vessels penetrating through the ligamentum teres, (<span class="emph_I">b</span>) superior and inferior epiphyseal vessels originating from the medial and lateral circumflex branches of the profunda femoris artery, and (<span class="emph_I">c</span>) metaphyseal vessels from the bone marrow. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#F43-13">Fig. 13-43</a>) During the ages of 4-7 years, contributions by the foveal and metaphyseal vessels are negligible, the majority being derived from the epiphyseal vessels, especially the lateral group.</div>
<div class="P">This solitary source of blood vasculature may predispose the patient to ischemic necrosis by not allowing for an alternate collateral supply if these epiphyseal vessels become obstructed. With progressing age, greater contributions are made by the foveal and metaphyseal sources, reducing the vulnerability for developing ischemia. In addition to this growth transition in vascular contribution, the position of these epiphyseal veins and arteries on the surface of the femoral neck in a subsynovial location renders them vulnerable to disruption from fracture, slipping of the epiphysis, intracapsular synovitis, or surgical pinning.

This may be delayed as long as 12 months after the initial infarction. Revascularization precipitates an absorption and deposition process for as long as 4 years. Resorption is characterized by phagocytosis, fibrosis, and formation of granulation tissue. Deposition of new bone occurs by directly overlaying existing dead trabeculae (creeping substitution). (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R254-13">22</a>) Gradually, deposition predominates and the head is remodeled, depending on the epiphyseal stresses during the whole process. Notably, during the necrotic and rebuilding processes, the articular cartilage is invariably not affected. The entire process from initial infarction to residual deformity takes a variable length of time, between 2 and 8 years.</div>

<div class="P">Following completion of the disease process, the reconstituted femoral head may take on a number of altered configurations.

<div class="P">Radiographically, the progression of Kienb&#x00F6;ck&#x2019;s disease can be staged. In the early stages of the disease (stage I), the radiographic examination may be initially unrewarding for many months. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R300-13">68</a>) In these circumstances, a bone scan or MRI study will often reveal the necrosis: the bone scan with focal increased uptake and the MRI with diminished signal.

With progression of the stages, however, a number of signs become evident.</div>
<div class="P">In stage II disease, altered density and compression fracture or collapse ensue. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R293-13">61</a>) Initially, the entire lunate will be increased in density. Later, with partial fragmentation and collapse, there will be a mixture of lucent and sclerotic areas. Occasionally, a linear subchondral fracture may be evident in the surface opposing the radius.

<div class="HD">General Considerations</div>
<div class="P">Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common, self-limiting, but painful and disabling disorder involving the patellar tendon-tibial tubercle complex in adolescent individuals. The first reports in 1903, made independently by Robert Bayley Osgood and Carl Schlatter, emphasized the apparent close relationship with the onset of the disease and antecedent trauma. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R307-13">1</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R308-13">2</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R309-13">3</a>) Subsequent descriptions have erroneously implicated avascular necrosis as the cause of the disease.</div>

<div class="HD">Clinical Features</div>
<div class="P">Distinctively, the disease is most frequently encountered in adolescents between 11 and 15 years of age. Males are far more commonly affected than females. An antecedent history of a single violent injury or activity involving repetitive knee flexion and extension movements is usual. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R310-13">4</a>) Symptoms are typically localized over the tibial tubercle and include pain, tenderness, and soft tissue swelling. In the absence of conclusive radiographic findings, the presence of these symptoms allows the diagnosis to be made. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R311-13">5</a>) Contraction of the quadriceps muscle against resistance exacerbates the localized pain. The condition is bilateral in 25-50&#x0025; of cases. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R312-13">6</a>) The course is chronic and tends to recur over a period of months to several years but usually ceases by the age of 18. Occasionally, symptoms may persist into adulthood.</div>

<div class="HD">Pathologic Features</div>
<div class="P">A common misconception is that Osgood-Schlatter disease represents avascular necrosis of the developing tibial tuberosity. The pathologic abnormalities are most consistent with inflammatory changes at the distal patellar tendon. Every case will exhibit increased cellularity, vascularity, intratendinous fibrocartilage, and signs of chronic inflammation. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R312-13">6</a>) Recent MRI studies support the concept that Osgood-Schlatter disease is primarily a tendinitis.</div>
<div class="P">Some investigators believe that, conversely, there is a partial disruption of the tibial patellar ligament attachment owing to trauma. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R313-13">7</a>) The combination of the redirected pull of the powerful quadriceps muscle group on the mechanically weak ligament-cartilage attachment at the tibial tuberosity predisposes to this avulsion. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R311-13">5</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R314-13">8</a>) Depending on the stage of ossification of the tubercle, a piece of cartilage or bone, or both, is displaced, creating a localized inflammatory response. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R313-13">7</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R315-13">9</a>) Alternatively, heterotopic new bone may form in the inflamed patellar ligament.

In addition, slight internal rotation of the leg about 5&#x00B0; moves the laterally placed tuberosity into its true lateral profile. The assessment of soft tissue changes in conjunction with bony alterations also requires two lateral views to be taken of each knee: one with a lowered peak kilovoltage and one with a higher peak kilovoltage to optimally demonstrate changes in both components.

<div class="P">There are relatively little data published on the pathology of Scheuermann&#x2019;s disease at any stage of its development. Although the exact pathogenetic mechanism has not been clearly delineated, the target site for histologic abnormalities appears to be at the cartilaginous growth plate-bone interface (discovertebral junction) of the vertebral body. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#F61-13">Fig. 13-61</a>) Normally, each vertebral body discal surface is covered by growing cartilage, which is responsible for the development of vertical height of each segment. The peripheral ring epiphysis does not contribute to this vertical dimension but serves as an attachment for the peripheral annulus fibers. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R324-13">18</a>,<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R341-13">35</a>)</div>
<div class="P">Histopathologic studies of the discovertebral junction have not discovered the precise initiating factor in the disorder. However, it appears that the earliest abnormalities are thinning and focal areas of degeneration occurring within the cartilaginous growth plate. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R313-13">7</a>) Nuclear endplate impressions and swelling of the nucleus pulposus have been implicated but their roles have not been determined.

Displacement of the growth plate anteriorly adjacent to the herniation may cause the vertebral body to elongate in its sagittal dimension. The prolapsed disc material consists of annular and nuclear tissue, which may remain localized, extend horizontally beneath the cartilage plate, or even separate the peripheral ring epiphysis (<span class="emph_I">limbus bone</span>) from the vertebral body. Notably, there is no evidence of ischemic necrosis.</div>

<div class="P">The most frequent age of onset is between 11 and 20 years. There is a definite male predominance.

Some individuals will be entirely asymptomatic, whereas others will suffer acute pain. Presenting findings may include joint effusion, painful joint motion, clicking, locking, and localized tenderness over the site of osteochondrosis. An antecedent history of acute trauma may be elicited. Usually, the onset is not directly attributable to a single event or group of factors. A hereditary tendency has been evident in some cases involving the knee, especially in shorter-statured individuals. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R355-13">49</a>) In general, the treatment goal for osteochondritis dissecans is to preserve a smooth congruity between the opposing articulating surfaces.

<div class="P">Examination of the involved location macroscopically reveals a typical appearance. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R313-13">7</a>) Usually, the overlying cartilage shows a surrounding furrow demarcating a circular or elliptical defect of &#x003C; 2 cm. The lesion may be firmly or loosely adherent to the underlying bone. Occasionally, there may be fragmentation of the sequestered segment. Microscopically, the loose body is composed of all cartilage or both bone and cartilage (osteochondral loose body). The majority of the overlying cartilage maintains its viability and may continue to proliferate and even calcify, gradually enlarging its overall size. Conversely, the separated bone is wholly necrotic. Individual trabeculae appear thickened with new bone, representing the phenomenon of creeping substitution with attempted healing. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R360-13">54</a>) The opposing site of origin is covered with fibrous tissue and shows surface osseous metaplasia with deposition peripherally. Interposed between the isolated segment and the adjacent bone, fibrous and fibrocartilaginous tissue is present.</div>

(<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#F70-13">Fig. 13-70</a>) Radiographically, the lesion is characterized by abnormalities at three areas: site of origin, the sequestered fragment, and the interposed zone between origin and fragment.

The most notable feature of the isolated fragment is its ability to be mobile within the joint and be found in a location quite distant from its site of origin. This is the most symptomatic feature of the disorder and requires surgical removal. Lesions &#x003C; 2 mm are usually stable, whereas those &#x003E; 8 mm are generally unstable. (<a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#R368-13">62</a>) On isotopic bone scan the greater the uptake, the more likely the fragment is unstable.
