<div class="P">The release of <span class="emph_I">Essentials of Skeletal Radiology</span> in 1987 was a dream fulfilled for both of us. We had hardly blinked an eye before the publishers were requesting us to consider a second edition, and now we have completed the third. This edition has been a monumental task, which has taken approximately 3 years to research, write, and publish. A task of this magnitude is never accomplished without significant support from numerous people assisting in many different ways.</div>
<div class="P">Our contributing authors have provided a distinct and unique contribution to this third edition and we wish to recognize their efforts:</div>

</div>
<div class="P">There have been several new topics added to <a class="LK" href="sid390243.html#B01382540-C6">Chapter 6 (&#x201C;Diagnostic Imaging of the Musculoskeletal System&#x201D;)</a>, the nucleus of which has been provided by Norman W.

We thank him for his endless efforts on our behalf. A special thank you is due to Ms. Erica L. Collier, able assistant and secretary to Dr. Kettner at the Logan College of Chiropractic. Erica received endless phone calls and helped in locating the Logan radiology staff, always on short notice. Her pleasant attitude and quick response to our needs with faxing and e-mailing numerous documents has been most appreciated.</div>
<div class="P">Special thanks to Michael L. Manco-Johnson, M.D., F.A.C.R., Professor of Radiology and Medicine, Chairman of the Department of Radiology, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, Colorado, and Ray F. Kilcoyne, M.D., Professor of Radiology, Department of Radiology, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, Colorado, for allowing their valuable case material from various departments at the university to be photographed and utilized in this third edition. Thanks also to the many radiology residents at this university who have secured unique skeletal radiology cases for our teaching file and, in particular, this third edition. Many of those residents&#x2019; names appear scattered throughout various chapters following their case material.</div>
<div class="P">
<a class="LK" href="sid505815.html#B01382540-C8">Chapter 8 (&#x201C;Skeletal Dysplasias&#x201D;)</a> of this book provided a particular challenge in upgrading the case material. The staff of Children&#x2019;s Hospital, Department of Radiology, Denver, Colorado, was most cooperative in allowing us to photograph their skeletal teaching file. These cases are dispersed throughout the textbook, particularly in the area of dysplasias. Our gratitude goes specifically to John D. Strain, M.D., Chairman of the Department of Radiology, Children&#x2019;s Hospital, Denver, Colorado, for his assistance in obtaining this case material.</div>
<div class="P">The majority of the new photographs for this third edition were skillfully processed and perfected by the able staff at the Pro Lab, Inc., Denver, Colorado. The quality of their work is evident by the end product.</div>
<div class="P">Thanks to those who assisted us at Lippincott Williams &#x0026; Wilkins in the production of this book, including all who worked behind the scenes and whom we never met or interacted with.</div>
<div class="P">Special thanks to Karen K. Gulliver, freelance managing editor, for her diligent, thorough review and processing of this huge manuscript. She did a great job in the second edition and equally outstanding work in the third edition.</div>

<div class="P">With a deep sense of gratitude, I wish to thank my devoted wife, companion, and best friend, Inge. Her understanding, support, and unconditional love fashioned the vehicle that carried me as I traveled the difficult road of this third edition. Special thanks to my children, Kimberley Ann, Philip Andrew, and Alicia Marie. They have readily forgiven their father&#x2019;s frequent absences during this project. I want to especially acknowledge my most devoted follower, Cecelia G. Yochum, my mother, who gave me life and nurtured and encouraged me throughout my entire career. She knew of this third edition and inspired me to work hard to finish it. Unfortunately, she passed away on August 22, 2001. I hope she would have been proud of my efforts and the finished product.</div>
<div class="P">I wish to acknowledge and thank the following special individuals who have shaped my professional career and touched my personal life:</div>

<li class="LM"><div class="P">my associate, Chad J. Maola, B.S., D.C., who has co-authored five chapters in this edition.

I could not have gotten through this without their unflagging support.</div></li>
<li class="LM"><div class="P">my able typist, Debbie K. Schlosser, for the time she freely gave when her energy was needed to type and repeatedly review chapters and manuscript submissions.

<div class="P">The inspiration to undertake the third edition of this text came from the many doctors and students who have attended my lectures from coast to coast, and I wish to thank them for providing this motivation.</div>
<div class="P">And finally, thanks to my co-author, Dr. Lindsay J. Rowe, for his efforts on behalf of this third edition, particularly his work on our new chapter, &#x201C;Masqueraders of Musculoskeletal Disease.&#x201D;</div>
<div class="SG"><div class="PN">Terry R. Yochum</div></div>
<div class="P">With a few words much needs to be acknowledged. This book was born in the early 1980s out of an idea to do things better, to consolidate, to explain, to bring logic to just one area of human disease. Along the way many contributed&#x2014;patients, students, colleagues, publishers, and all of our ancillary staff. Many went to extraordinary lengths to make these volumes better, for which we all benefit. All manner of obstacles have been overcome. With this third edition all of these ideals continue with but a few exceptions.</div>
<div class="P">My thanks go to Stephen Heaney of the Medical Communication Unit at John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, for their fine photographic reproductions. To the radiographic technologists at our Newcastle Hospitals for their fine work in obtaining examinations of the highest quality and bringing cases of interest to my
<a name="PGxix"> </a><div class="pagenum"><div>P.xix</div></div>
<br clear="all">
attention is greatly appreciated. Similarly, the many radiology, medical, and surgical residents who ensured all manner of cases come to me for review I am indebted.</div>
<div class="P">For the students of Medicine in Newcastle and Chiropractic throughout the world who I teach, they provide the perpetual fertile environs and impetus to write, research, and understand this subject area. Similarly, at the medical and chiropractic meetings that I address domestically and throughout the world, I glean a great deal that is directly reapplied back to teaching. A large proportion of the case material contained in this third edition has been derived from these interactions.</div>
<div class="P">Thanks to Professor Joe Ghabriel, M.D., orthopedist and spine surgeon; Eric Ho, M.D., pediatric orthopedist; and Martin Epstein, M.D., endocrinologist and bone mineral specialist, for securing additional case material and allowing me to review their patients&#x2019; studies on a regular basis and for providing me with great stimulus to increase my expertise and knowledge.</div>
<div class="P">To James Brandt, M.S., D.C., F.A.C.O., in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for his perceptive insight, encouragement, guidance, and friendship over many years I am very grateful to have him and his family as part of my life. Special recognition goes to Brian Nook, D.C., C.C.S.P., of Perth, Australia, Associate Professor, School of Chiropractic Murdoch University. As we shared an office in 1985-86 during the genesis of this text he provided a sense of direction, purpose, and vision, which has been rekindled for this third edition. My long-term friends and colleagues from different parts of the globe Michael Buna, B.S., D.C., from Victoria, Canada; Shane Carter, B.S., D.C., of Inverarie, Scotland; and Wayne Minter, B.S., D.C., in Sydney, Australia, have given that much needed sense of perspective, balance, and humor continuing through all previous and present editions.</div>
<div class="P">Finally, to my extraordinary wife, Anne Baxter, B.S., M.D., and my son, Ryan, the time given to this project is time lost for us but much gained for others. You are indelibly entwined throughout these pages more than anyone could know. You are my life.</div>
<div class="P">I hope in some way these books will assist all of those who use them and will make a difference to those patients that seek their care. I dedicate my last contribution to this book to these patients.</div>
