<div class="FRTITLE">PREFACE to the Third Edition</div>
<div class="TLV1 TLV1-noHD " id="B01382540.0-14" id_xpath="/OVIDBOOK[1]/METADATA[1]/FRTXT[5]/TLV1[1]">
<div class="P">The overwhelming success of the first and second editions of <span class="emph_I">Essentials of Skeletal Radiology</span> has now given us the opportunity to publish the third edition. We believed in our work and were convinced of its merits from the beginning. What we did not fully perceive was the magnitude of the need for this text. We have been startled by the widespread acceptance of this publication. Although initially targeted to fill a need in the chiropractic educational system, it has also been adopted into the curricula of various medical and osteopathic teaching institutions worldwide. We have often seen the worn and torn covers on our books as a testimony to its use. The number of citations of the book in many scientific publications has been quite rewarding to see, and although morally and financially distressing, a form of compliment was offered by the numerous illegal and counterfeit copies that have surfaced here and abroad.</div>
<div class="P">The most common question asked of any author in preparing a new edition is, &#x201C;Are there any differences from the previous edition?&#x201D; This text has undergone significant structural and content changes. Each chapter has been revised, some more extensively than others, and a new chapter (<a class="LK" href="sid1103859.html#B01382540-C18">Chapter 18, <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;Masqueraders of Musculoskeletal Disease&#x201D;</span></a>) has been added to this edition. We feel these modifications and additions will provide the reader with a more &#x201C;clinical&#x201D; based text with respect to understanding the approach to radiology as it relates to practice. In addition, a sample CD of cervical spine anatomy, range of motion testing, and demonstration of orthopedic and neurological tests has been included with this text. This CD was created in association with Primal Pictures, Ltd., of London, England.</div>
<div class="P">Our approach to a more clinical text will be evident early, as the reader notices the modifications made to <a class="LK" href="sid114460.html#B01382540-C1">Chapter 1</a>. In this chapter, carefully selected radiographs displaying commonly found pathologies have been added for comparison with the normal radiographs. These images have been labeled <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;clinicoradiologic correlations,&#x201D;</span> and we feel they will emphasize the importance of being able to identify normal in order to better identify abnormal. These insertions will allow the reader to understand that many radiologic findings may be subtle and that careful attention to detail must be applied when reviewing radiographs. This comparison approach has been made easy by images displayed in close approximation. Also, a new <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;common pitfalls&#x201D;</span> section has been added to provide helpful information in hopes of preventing the clinician from making the most frequently seen exposure, positioning, and technological errors.</div>
<div class="P">
<a class="LK" href="sid254553.html#B01382540-C3">Chapter 3</a> has grown significantly with the addition of many new figures, references, and considerable expansion of the text. The addition of a <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;synonym section&#x201D;</span> should be very helpful. The normal variant segment has had many new images added to both the spine and extremities section.</div>
<div class="P">A quick glance at <a class="LK" href="sid390243.html#B01382540-C6">Chapter 6</a> again demonstrates our efforts in not only compiling an informative text but also providing a clinical reference book. Remarkable new technologies continue to emerge, sometimes complementing and occasionally supplanting the existing modalities. The sheer volume of knowledge and the rate at which the knowledge base expands are both increasing rapidly. This has resulted in numerous areas of imaging specialties and subspecialties based on anatomy, imaging technology, or both. However, the edges of these specialty areas are not always black and white. While the focus of an individual practitioner may be specialized, it cannot be so narrow as to eliminate the need for an &#x201C;overview&#x201D; perspective capable of recognizing findings that may indicate an abnormality in a different anatomical system, or necessitate the application of a different imaging technology. In this chapter we have incorporated sections on the technological advances made in the areas of magnetic resonance angiography, DEXA osteoporosis scanning, musculoskeletal diagnostic ultrasound, and upright (stand-up) MRI of the spine.</div>
<div class="P">Further progression through the text will make evident the changes to <a class="LK" href="sid1058196.html#B01382540-C15">Chapter 15</a>, which will enable the clinician to create a competent report and to better understand the importance of report writing. A <span class="emph_B">report commentary</span> section has been added to each case study in this chapter to critique the reports provided. This approach emphasizes the common errors people make while creating a report and reiterates the proper format of report writing.</div>
<div class="P">The new chapter, <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;Masqueraders of Musculoskeletal Disease,&#x201D;</span> has been added to present an overview of the clinical findings and imaging applications for areas other than the musculoskeletal system. This new chapter emphasizes plain films as well as CT and MRI of the more common disorders involving the head, soft tissues of the neck, chest, and abdomen that can mimic musculoskeletal complaints. It follows the usual format of our textbook with the clinical and radiological features emphasized.</div>
<div class="P">Despite the numerous additions and modifications, there has been a vigilant effort to maintain the hallmark features and core material of the first and second editions, so familiarity in this third edition may be evident. As we outlined in the preface of the first and second editions, the emphasis has been placed on constructing a clear and concise presentation. Significant effort has been directed at containing the size of this text to maintain its usefulness in the classroom, while attempting to provide a comprehensive review that incorporates the phenomenal technological advances in diagnostic imaging that have occurred in the interim.</div>
<div class="P">Subsequent editions are like retouching original works of art. Though there is always the risk of spoiling it, the challenge of constructing a revision that is better than our previous works provided inspiration for this third edition.</div>
<div class="P">The existing format has been enhanced by numerous design and color changes. We believe these changes will improve readability and accentuate important points. Most of the diagrams have been highlighted to emphasize key radiologic features. Headings and figure captions have been selectively colored. Some aspects of the book have remained the same owing to an
<a name="PGxvi"> </a><div class="pagenum"><div>P.xvi</div></div>
<br clear="all">
overwhelming positive response to their appearance in the previous edition. For example, the structure of <a class="LK" href="sid364247.html#B01382540-C5">Chapters 5</a>, <a class="LK" href="sid505815.html#B01382540-C8">8</a>, <a class="LK" href="sid653929.html#B01382540-C10">10</a>, <a class="LK" href="sid806035.html#B01382540-C11">11</a>, <a class="LK" href="sid938315.html#B01382540-C12">12</a>, <a class="LK" href="sid965950.html#B01382540-C13">13</a>, and <a class="LK" href="sid1026114.html#B01382540-C14">14</a> using progressive headings of <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;general considerations,&#x201D; &#x201C;clinical features,&#x201D; &#x201C;pathologic features,&#x201D; &#x201C;radiologic features,&#x201D;</span> and <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;treatment and prognosis&#x201D;</span> has been maintained. The <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;capsule summary&#x201D;</span> remains an integral component to assist the reader in quick review for examination or to expedite differential considerations. A key addition to the second edition that has been repeated in this third edition is the <span class="emph_B">&#x201C;medicolegal implications&#x201D;</span> section that follows many of the conditions discussed. This reflects the increasing emphasis that diagnostic imaging has assumed in clinical practice and is designed to complement the case management decision-making process in a way that will reduce liability. The use of imaging and treatment <span class="emph_B">algorithms</span> in <a class="LK" href="sid364247.html#B01382540-C5">Chapter 5</a> will significantly impact the treatment of many patients with spondylolisthesis. In addition, the special section on <span class="emph_B">mnemonics</span> continues to appear as an appendix at the end of each volume.</div>
<div class="P">Numerous favorable comments have been relayed to us regarding how the references in the first and second editions have been used as the basis for various research and other scientific articles and case reports. Although a vast amount of relevant literature was again systematically reviewed for this third edition, we have attempted to limit additional citations to those of significant merit. All owners of this third edition, whether student, teacher, researcher, or practitioner, should find these additions useful to their clinical and scientific endeavors.</div>
<div class="P">The photographic reproductions and diagrams have always been listed as one of the most attractive and valuable characteristics of the book. New diagrams have been added and improvements on existing ones have been made, such as the skeletal distribution diagrams that incorporate new localizing symbols to identify most common and less common sites of involvement. We have selectively removed some images and replaced them with new ones when better examples could be found. We have also continued with the teaching principle of placing arrows on images that correlate with the descriptive caption and direct the readers to important facets of the case. When possible, the case material has been augmented with bone scans, CT, and MRI to reflect the technological revolution in musculoskeletal diagnosis.</div>
<div class="P">As with the first and second editions, this text is meant to be used for at least three purposes: as a <span class="emph_BIT">teaching text</span> aimed at all those who seek knowledge and expertise in musculoskeletal disorders, as a <span class="emph_BIT">reference text</span> when information is sought, and as a <span class="emph_BIT">clinical aid</span> to assist you with those patients who seek your care. In this regard, we encourage you to read this text carefully and use it for its intended purposes.</div>
<div class="P">We also hope the book will help the reader avoid the many pitfalls of clinical decision making&#x2014;one of the most obvious being addressed in a quote from an unknown author, <span class="emph_I">&#x201C;You see what you look for and recognize what you know.&#x201D;</span>
