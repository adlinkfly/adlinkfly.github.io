<div class="P">We are all so busy in our lives that I often ponder how we accomplish the everyday things we must do, let alone also find time for new or additional endeavors. Well, Terry R. Yochum and Lindsay J. Rowe have an extraordinarily busy daily schedule and, again, they have found the time and energy to produce a third edition to their highly successful <span class="emph_I">Essentials of Skeletal Radiology.</span>
</div>
<div class="P">This new edition represents the pinnacle of Terry&#x2019;s and Lindsay&#x2019;s knowledge and compilation of work in this field. Today, they have added four more contributing authors for a total of 11. Incredibly, they have added 500 new illustrations and more than 1000 new references.</div>
<div class="P">The reader will greatly appreciate the use of a new bolder color and shadings to highlight and enhance those important points that are seen in the headings, tables, diagrams, and figure captions. The quality of the reproductions is excellent, and there is no question of what the authors wish to demonstrate with wellplaced arrows at the areas of interest. Of course, this text follows the wonderful fluid writing style previously seen in their earlier editions. I particularly enjoy the capsule summaries, which are a welcome highlight of the text.</div>
<div class="P">I believe you will like their new chapter, &#x201C;Masqueraders of Musculoskeletal Disease.&#x201D; Here, they have utilized plain films, CT, and MRI in areas of the head, neck, chest, and abdomen to provide an insight to other abnormalities that could mimic musculoskeletal complaints.</div>
<div class="P">I am very impressed with this new and wonderful text, just as I was when I reviewed the earlier editions. <span class="emph_I">Essentials of Skeletal Radiology</span> is for every student in the field. I believe the blending of the new material and additions into the solid foundation of the second edition has produced a masterful harmony of needed core skeletal information with the newer imaging of the twenty-first century.</div>
<div class="P">Thank you, Terry and Lindsay, for a wonderful work and a job well done.</div>
