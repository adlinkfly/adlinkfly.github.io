<div class="P">It is my privilege to once again provide a foreword for this remarkable new edition of the text <span class="emph_I">Essentials of Skeletal Radiology,</span> by Terry R. Yochum and Lindsay J. Rowe. As with the previous editions, this work is characterized by impeccable organization, a text that is extremely user friendly, supplemented by vivid illustrations and tabular material that provides summaries of the important points discussed in the adjacent paragraphs. What sets this book apart from others is the completeness of the coverage of the various disease processes that affect the musculoskeletal system. Tumors, infections, metabolic and articular disorders, traumatic conditions, and developmental abnormalities among other things&#x2014;it is all here in the pages of this work. The manifestations of these processes are illustrated through the use of all imaging methods, ranging from conventional radiography to MRI. The legends that accompany this illustrative material are clear and to the point.</div>
<div class="P">The quality of this text comes as no surprise to me. Both of the authors are experienced and knowledgeable in the ways of musculoskeletal diseases, both are gifted writers, and both share a bond of enthusiasm and energy that is required to complete the task. I have known both Terry and Lindsay for many, many years, and they are formidable clinicians and educators. They have a message and a desire to have others hear that message and, through careful and thoughtful planning, they present that message throughout the pages of this text. I know full well what is required to maintain one&#x2019;s focus during the months and years of the publication process, to stay focused and on time, and I am aware that both of these authors had the drive to see the process through. The result is a text that will bring ample reward to the reader, providing him or her with information that will ensure a more complete understanding of the disease process and the ability to provide correct diagnoses in a more timely fashion. The result will be improved patient care, something we all desire.</div>
<div class="P">Terry and Lindsay, congratulations again on a job well done. To the potential readers, here is critical information, now at your fingertips, presented in a painless fashion. Enjoy!</div>
